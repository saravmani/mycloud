When multiple versions of the CLI are installed, and you donâ€™t want to run the latest,
then you create a global.json
file in the same folder of the application and ensure it contains at least the following:

{

  "sdk": {

    "version": "2.0.0"

  }

}


Note This version of the CLI tooling is not the same as the version of
the .NET Core runtime the application will use. The runtime
version is specified in the project file,

csproj XML file and changing the value of the TargetFramework element.
The value refers to the moniker that identifies the version (such as netcoreapp2.0).

Lucky for us Angular has a cache for the digest loop.
So the browser will never get stuck if you have an infinite digest loop.
 Angular knows when you reach a 10 level depth of a digest cycle.

Angular allows you to change this limit from 10 to another number,
but there is really no reason for your application to reach a 10 level depth of digest cycle. 
It wasn't really necessary to create two watches in order to create an infinite digest cycle.

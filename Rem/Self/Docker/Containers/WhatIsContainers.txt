Containers are like virtual machine.
but technology is completely different.
it is verly light weight. startup time is very less.
when the container got created we can able to set the constraints
it is light weight , 
***when it is created it will not preallocate
any resources

what ever changes made within container will get modified or affected by
host or other container


Container is isolated resource controlled & portable
operating env.,. the application within container will not
be affected by system and system will not get 
affected by the application which running inside container



Containers can't run any UI part like WPF, WInforms. It can only host back end part

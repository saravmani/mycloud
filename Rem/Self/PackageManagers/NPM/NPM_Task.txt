NPM Tasks
---------------
Common task
    Build
    start /restart webserver
    transpilation
    bundling
    Run Tests
    etc.,
    
    the commands whcih we are providing under script section of 
    package.json file
it will be executed on Operating system's commandline.

{"scripts":{
    "<name>":"<command to be executed>"
}}



we can even pring some thing in command line

  "scripts": {
    "mytest":"echo \" hihihaha\" "
  },

//npm run mytest -- this ll print the echo vlaue in command prompt

even we can move the files

  "scripts": {
    "move-files":"mv source/* destination/"
    
  },


copy task (copy the files from one folder to another folder)
------------

  "scripts": {
    "copy-files":"cp src/* destination/ & cp src_css/*.css content/",
    "move-files":"mv source/* destination/",
    "combine-scirpt":"npm run copy-files && npm run move-files", //run two different task items with single command

  },
above command will copy all the files form src and move to destination folder
and copy all the css files from src_css folder into content folder

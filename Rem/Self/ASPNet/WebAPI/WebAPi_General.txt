The engineering team took advantage of the opportunity and built ASP.NET Web API 
such that it had no dependencies on any of the core framework types found in System.Web.dll.
This enabled two things: first, it meant that ASP.NET Web API could evolve in a completely 
self-contained manner (and it could continue to iterate quickly because it is delivered via NuGet).
Second, because there were no external dependencies to System.Web.dll, and therefore,
no dependencies to IIS, ASP.NET Web API included the capability to run in a custom host
(for example, a console application, Windows service, etc.)

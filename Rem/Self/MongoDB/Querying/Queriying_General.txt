Mongo shell is special in that it uses a JavaScript interpreter. You can interact with the
database using JavaScript Expressions, making it easy to perform various tasks. 

Mongo stores data in databases which are separated into collections of documents.
To create a new collection, we simply need to insert a document and the collection will be created as a side effect.

When making your requests for documents in Mongo, you include a document in the
request describing the characteristics of the objects you want to get back.
  The documents themselves already contain all of the appropriate fields, so no specific join operation needs to happen.

Data is stored in BSON formate (binary json)
Storing the data this way makes it much easier to access related information.
Searching on specific attributes of an object or
sorting items based on a field works naturally and quickly.

Unique identifier (Unique accross SPECIFIC COLLECTION)
-------------------
You may have noticed that the object returned by Mongo had an additional field, the _id field.
Every item in a Mongo database has this field. If it's not specified at the time the object is created,
one will be assigned by Mongo. This field must be unique across a specific collection,
but otherwise can be any identifying string you wish to use if you don't want to work directly with the Mongo IDs.

db.users.find({firstName:'SaravMani'})

to find the document we are passing a document. the output is all the matching documents will be returned
(i.e all the documents whose first name is SaravMani)


NOTE: Mongo supports nested levels upto 100

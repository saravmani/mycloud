string litteral type
------------------------------
like other data types we can able to define a variable with strict to particular string value

let someVariable:"EXACTSOMEVALUE";
in this someVariable we can able to assign only the string value which is mentioned as types

someVariable= "haha other";// throws an error
someVariable ="EXACTSOMEVALUE"; //fine

we can use this string litteral type to restrict to some range of values 
ex:

let someVariable:"Male"|"Female";
someVariable = "Male";/fine
someVariable="ewrew";//error

like c# enums we can use this string litteral type to restrict with few string values

Type Aliases
-----------------------
declaring multiple string litterals is complex to read.
so we can use Type Aliases

type enumGeneder = "Male"|"Female"|"Other";
let studentGender:enumGeneder;
//this is short hand .. and more readable

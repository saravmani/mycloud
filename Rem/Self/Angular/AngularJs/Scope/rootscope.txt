 every Scope has a parent scope

When we create a new ng-app, a root scope is generated with it.
Every Scope is a descendant of root scope.

Many old angular applications use root scope to communicate between different parts of the application.
Since all controllers can inject a root scope and use it, and since all Scopes inherit from root scope eventually,
it is very easy to share data between Scopes by putting variables on the root scope.

using $rootScope to communicate between different parts of the application should be avoided as much as you can.
This is a very bad practice that can cause your code to become more complex and harder to maintain.

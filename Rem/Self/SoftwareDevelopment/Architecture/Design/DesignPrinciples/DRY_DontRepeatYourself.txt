DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
----------------------------------------
#My Understanding - Every piece of knowledge shoul have single implementation. It should not be repeated
 Knowledge can - Abstractions, Algorithms, Approches, Execution patterns

Viloation of this principle will produce more maintanabilities issues
ex: Bug fixes at multiple places, Feature implementation have to be done multiple times etc, Multiple testing
multiple releases etc.,

Even we can take authentication to seperate application, and make use of it by all client applications
So, all the security related fixes goes to one place infuture

Ex: Dont mention connections trings multiple places
Connection Open Logic
Complex object creation logic
Logging

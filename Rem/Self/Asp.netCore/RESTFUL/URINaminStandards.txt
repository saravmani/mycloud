Naming Guidelines
------------------------
URI should not have verbs or actions. it should have an Nouns
ex: api/GetAutherList -- it is wrong
ex: api/Authers -- it is correct. we can use get method to get the list of authers

to get specific resource use /{id}
ex: api/Authers/{autherId}

So consumers can able to predict and understand the api structure

hierarchy representation
-----------------------------------
ex: api/Authers/{autherId}/books/{bookId}

order by
--------------
api/Authers?orderby=name

Asp.net core team advising not use convention based routing. and ask us to use
attribute based routing

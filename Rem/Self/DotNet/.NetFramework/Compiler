The C# compiler, by default,
automatically looks in the MSCorLib.dll assembly even if you don’t explicitly tell it to. The MSCorLib.dll
assembly contains the definitions of all of the core Framework Class Library (FCL) types, such as
Object, Int32, String, and so on.



namespace X {
public sealed class B { ... } // TypeDef: CompanyName.X.B
}
}
The comment on the right of the class definitions above indicates the real name of the type the
compiler will emit into the type definition metadata table; this is the real name of the type from the
CLR’s perspective.

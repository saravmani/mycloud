should create multiple tempdb data files, and the right number for this is typically the number of cores on your server, up to eight. This is to reduce contention in memory for those data file pages.
A lot of people think this has to do with disc, and by spreading the files over multiple discs you'll get better I/O. Really, the pages that we're worrying about having contention on almost always live in memory, so it's more that we'd have memory contention if we only had a single page, that only a single process could write to that page at a given time. So that's important to note. It is done for you in SQL Server 2016 and above. One warning: if you're using SQL Server on an Azure VM template that came with SQL Server already installed, those templates were built with a machine that had one CPU, so your tempdb will only have one file.

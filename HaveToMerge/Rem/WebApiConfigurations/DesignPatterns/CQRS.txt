Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern

Segregate operations that read data from operations that update data by using separate interfaces. 
This can maximize performance, scalability, and security. 


In traditional data management systems, both commands (updates to the data) and queries (requests for data) 
are executed against the same set of entities in a single data repository.

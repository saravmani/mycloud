Hollywood Principle is a technique for
building frameworks or components so that
lower-level components can be hooked


* Don’t call us, we’ll call you. it s called - The Hollywood Principle
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the Hollywood Principle, we allow low-level components
to hook themselves into a system, but the high-level
components determine when they are needed, and how. In
other words, the high-level components give the low-level
components a “don’t call us, we’ll call you” treatment.

#Template pattern can be used for this


How does the Hollywood Principle
relate to the Dependency Inversion
Principle that we learned a few chapters
back?
A: The Dependency Inversion
Principle teaches us to avoid the use of
concrete classes and instead work as
much as possible with abstractions. The
Hollywood Principle is a technique for
building frameworks or components so that
lower-level components can be hooked
into the computation, but without creating
dependencies between the lower-level
components and the higher-level layers. So,
they both have the goal of decoupling, but
the Dependency Inversion Principle makes a
much stronger and general statement about
how to avoid dependencies in design.
The Hollywood Principle gives us a
technique for creating designs that allow
low-level structures to interoperate while
preventing other classes from becoming too
dependent on them.

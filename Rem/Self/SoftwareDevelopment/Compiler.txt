Compiler
=======================

compilers have a pipeline structure. Source code processing consists of three main phases: 

Syntax analysis,
Semantic analysis,
Code Generation


Static code analysis
----------------------------
Static Code Analysis feature of Visual Studio performs static code analysis
on code to help developers identify potential design, globalization, interoperability,
performance, security, and a lot of other categories of potential problems 
according to Microsoft's rules that mainly targets best 
practices in writing code, and there is a large set of those rules
included with Visual Studio grouped into different categorized targeting 
specific coding issues like security, design, Interoperability, globalizations and others.


Dynamic analysis
--------------------
There is also Dynamic analysis which performed on executing programs using 
software testing techniques such as Code Coverage for example.

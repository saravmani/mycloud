with debugdiag we can do  below
Crash Analysis
Hang analysis
Memory Leak Analysis
Performance analysis

The Debug Diagnostic Tool (DebugDiag) is designed to assist in troubleshooting issues such as hangs,
slow performance, memory leaks or fragmentation,
 and crashes in any user-mode process.
The tool includes additional debugging scripts focused on Internet Information Services (IIS) applications,
web data access components, COM+ and
related Microsoft technologies.

Speciffically it was designed for IIS. But we can use for any processes.


Other tools used to create dumps include using ADPlus (included in the Debugging Tools for Windows), or even DebugDiag.
 Using DebugDiag lets you create rules for when dumps are captured,
such as when a particular exception is raised.
This can be very helpful for grabbing a snapshot of memory as the error occurs so
that you can troubleshoot errors in ULS logs in SharePoint.

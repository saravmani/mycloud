SQL server enterprise edition having this partition feature

Data in a partitioned table is partitioned based on a single column, the partition column, often called the partition key.
 Only one column can be used as the partition column, but it is possible to use a computed column.
 There is no sub partition option in SQL server

n alternative to partitioned tables (for those who donâ€™t have Enterprise Edition) is to create separate tables for each group of rows, union the tables in a view and then query the view instead of the tables.
This is called a partitioned view.

It is important to select a partition column that is almost always used as a filter in queries.
When the partition column is used as a filter in queries, SQL Server can access only the relevant partitions.
This is called partition elimination and can greatly improve performance when querying large tables.


we can use different file groups for the partitions. and for older data (if use Lastupdatedtime column for partitioning  ) file group as
readonly filegroup


Advantages
------------------
Backup we can do partion filegroup wise
Index rebuilding we can do for only lates file group (if business needs then we have to do for all partitions)
Query performance will improves

If it s a large table, we can do partion by year wise.



Range right, range left tells that on which side data needs to be stored

Right partition
ex: if we are having boundary points of 2012,2013 (....part1(<2012)...|....part2(>2012 and <2013)...|....part3(>2013)...)
and if the partition column has value of 2013 then it will get stored in part3(>2013) partion
if left partition means then data will goes to left side part2(>2012 and <2013)

when do Merge or split then this right and left will behaves differently

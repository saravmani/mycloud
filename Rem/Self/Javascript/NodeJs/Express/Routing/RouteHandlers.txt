Handling multiple route handlers for single route

we have multiple hanlders before and after response made. 
this is like adding middle ware for each route path.
there can be multiple next
Note: resp.send should be once.. it cannot be multiple

app.get("/getId",function(req,res,next){
    res.send("some data");
    next()
},
function(req,res){
    console.log("another handler called");
}
)

decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object,
either statically or dynamically,
without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

Decorator pattern help us to follow Open Close principle.

Ex:
  FileStream
  MemoryStream


As per my understanding
  Decorator vs Attributes
    Decorator we can dynamically modify at run time. but Attributes are static

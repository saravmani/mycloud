Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures,
trees are hierarchical data structures.. Main uses of trees include maintaining hierarchical data,
providing moderate access and insert/delete operations.

Tree Vocabulary: The top most node is called root of the tree. The elements that are directly under an
element are called its children. The element directly above something is called its parent.
For example, ‘a’ is a child of ‘f’, and ‘f’ is the parent of ‘a’.
Finally, elements with no children are called leaves.

Class is not a new type. it is actually a function


class Task{
}
console.log(typeof Task);//function
let task=newTask();
console.log(typeoftask);//object
console.log(task instanceof Task);//true

Class is a keyword which is another way to work with prototypes
Adding a method to a class is similar to adding a method to a prototype

console.log(task.showId===Task.prototype.showId);//true
//# actually the method will get added into a prototype of Task
//It is same in in ES5.. create function and add other functions to its prototype

we can't use the class before declaring it


we can able to assign a class to a variable and use it
let newClass=class Task{
    constructor(){
        console.log('constructingTask');
        }
        };
new newClass();//constructingTask


Difference between classes and functions
--------------------------------------------------
Class will not be added into window or any other global objects like functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
function Project(){};
console.log(window.Project===Project);//true

class Task{}
console.log(window.Task===Task);//false

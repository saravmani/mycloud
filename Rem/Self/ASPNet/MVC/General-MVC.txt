RedirectAction Vs RedirectPermenant
-----------------------------------------
The basic difference between the two is that RedirectPermanent sends the browser 
an HTTP 301 (Moved Permanently) status code whereas Redirect will
send an HTTP 302 status code.

Use RedirectPermanent if the resource has been moved permanently 
and will no longer be accessible in its previous location. 
Most browsers will cache this response and perform the redirect automatically 
without requesting the original resource again.

Use Redirect if the resource may be available in the same location (URL) in the future.

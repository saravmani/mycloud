Let keyword
----------------------
if (false) {
var x = "hello";
}
console.log(x);
This code will not fail as we might expect and it will just print undefined in the console

if (false) {
let x = "hello";
}
console.log(x);
This code will raise a ReferenceError: x is not defined because we are trying to
print a variable that has been defined inside another block.

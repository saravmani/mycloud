Container design principles

In the container model, a container image instance represents a single process. 

When you design a container image, you will see an ENTRYPOINT definition in the Dockerfile. This defines the process whose lifetime controls the lifetime of the container. When the process completes, the container lifecycle ends. Containers might represent long-running processes like web servers, but can also represent short-lived processes like batch jobs, which formerly might have been implemented as Azure WebJobs.

If the process fails, the container ends, and the orchestrator takes over. 
If the orchestrator was configured to keep five instances running and one fails, the orchestrator will create another container instance to replace the failed process. In a batch job, the process is started with parameters. When the process completes, the work is complete. 


You might find a scenario where you want multiple processes running in a single container. For that scenario, since there can be only one entry point per container, you could run a script within the container that launches as many programs as needed. For example, you can use Supervisor or a similar tool to take care of launching multiple processes inside a single container.

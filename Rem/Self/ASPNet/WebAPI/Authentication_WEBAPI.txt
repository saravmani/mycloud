Web api Authentication

Web API assumes that authentication happens in the host. For web-hosting,
 the host is IIS, which uses HTTP modules for authentication. 
 You can configure your project to use any of the authentication modules built in to IIS 
 or ASP.NET, or write your own HTTP module to perform custom authentication.

When the host authenticates the user, it creates a principal, 
which is an IPrincipal object that represents the security context under which code is running. 
The host attaches the principal to the current thread by setting Thread.CurrentPrincipal. 
The principal contains an associated Identity object that contains information about the user. 
If the user is authenticated, the Identity.IsAuthenticated property returns true.

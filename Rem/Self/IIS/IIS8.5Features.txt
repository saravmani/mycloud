Ideal-timeout action property in application pool's advanced settings
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In IIS 8.5 and later, the administrator has the option of suspending an idle worker process rather
 than terminating it. A suspended worker process remains alive but is paged-out to disk, 
reducing the system resources it consumes. When a user accesses the site again, the worker 
process wakes up from suspension and is quickly available. When an idle worker process is terminated, 
the worker process is shut down, and the startup period will be longer when the site is subsequently 
accessed. Terminating the process is the default behavior, and the same behavior that has been used 
in previous versions of IIS prior to IIS 8.5

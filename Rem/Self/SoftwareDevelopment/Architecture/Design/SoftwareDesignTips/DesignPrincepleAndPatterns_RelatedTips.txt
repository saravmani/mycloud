Design principles and patterns we can able to apply at any stage of develelopment cycle.
But better place is before starting develelopment we have to identify the places where we can 
implement those principles.

 Program to an interface not an implementation
 -------------------------------------------------
 here the word "interface " overridden. It can be super class, abstract class or interface.
 we can reword it as "program to super class".

 Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate them from what stays the same
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 this is the term which bassis for almost all design patterns.
 all patterns provide a way to let some part of a system vary independently of all other parts


 Design patterns and princeples are used to structure the code, with more flexibility and maintanability

 design patterns are very heighlevel. so we have to implement them. there is no readily available libraries.
 # but from my point of of MVC is a pattern, in .net. it seems it is readily available right :-)
# I understnad the ans. Actually MVC in .net is a framework to implement MVC pattern. Even with 
MVC framework also we can able to write not MVC pattern code...:-)

 moste of the patterns and principles are to solve issue in "Change in software"

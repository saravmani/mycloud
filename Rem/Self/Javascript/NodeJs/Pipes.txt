Pipes (Node JS)
-----------
if you have
water coming from a source (such as a water heater) and you want to direct it to a
destination (like a kitchen faucet), you can route that water from its source to its destination
by adding a pipe to connect the two.
Water can then flow from the source
through the pipe to the destination.

An example of using pipes is reading a file (ReadableStream) and writing its contents
to another file (WritableStream)
var readStream = fs.createReadStream('./original.txt')
var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('./copy.txt')
readStream#pipe(writeStream);

even we can write the stream directly into http response.

ex: static file serving
var server = http.createServer(function(req, res){
var url = parse(req.url);
var path = join(root, url.pathname);
var stream = fs.createReadStream(path);
stream.pipe(res);
});
in above example The file ReadStream is piped
back to the HTTP response to
complete the client request.

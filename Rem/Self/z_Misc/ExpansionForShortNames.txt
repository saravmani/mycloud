CSRF - cross site request forgery
	When an unauthorized system is able to access a resource, it is considered a cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) attack.

﻿CROS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a W3C Working Draft that defi nes how the browser and
server must communicate when accessing sources across origins. The basic idea behind CORS is
to use custom HTTP headers to allow both the browser and the server to know enough about each
other to determine if the request or response should succeed or fail.

SPA- Single page application


CRUD - create read update delete
SRS - SRS(Software Requirement Specifications)
POCO - Plain Old CLR Objects


OData  - Open data protocol - (supports by webapi. user can able to query the data using query string. Iqueriable<ClassName>)

CSRF - Cross site request forgery

ORM - object relational mapping (ORM)

PDB - Program database (PDB)
OWIN - Open web interface for.net
Realm has launched a new mobile database for .NET developers that is ideal for reactive app development, with live objects, change events, and support for unidirectional data flows. Built specifically for Xamarin, it offers easy object persistence and full query capabilities with a faster performance profile than incumbents.


SoC - Seperation of Concern (Concern means is aspect or part or feature)
	Concerns are the different aspects of software functionality. For instance, the "business logic" of software is a concern, and the interface through which a person uses this logic is another.
The separation of concerns is keeping the code for each of these concerns separate. Changing the interface should not require changing the business logic code, and vice versa.
Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is an excellent example of separating these concerns for better software maintainability.

XSD - XML Schema Defination
XSLT - Extensible style sheet language

REPL - read eval print loop
Node, like many other languages, provides a REPL (read-eval-print-loop) interface,
available by running node from the command line without any arguments. A REPL
allows you to write snippets of code and to get immediate results as each statement
is written and executed. It can be great for learning a programming language, running
simple tests, or even debugging.

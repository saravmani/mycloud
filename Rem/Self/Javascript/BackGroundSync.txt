Background sync
-----------------
It uses push messages and notifications, and it uses background sync. 
If the user tries to send a message when they have zero connectivity, 
then, thankfully, the message is sent in the background once they get connectivity.
In Chrome by default it is on


onsync service worker event which can fire in the background so that synchronization 
attempts can continue 
This API is intended to reduce the time between content creation and content synchronization 
with the server.

## Subnet & Subnet mask


### Subnet
- Logical division of a larger network.
- Mini-network within the main network, separating devices into smaller, more manageable groups.



##### Purpose of Subnet
1. Easy network Management
2. Increased security
3. Improve overall perormance

#### Subnet mask
- Identifier for a subnet
- subnet mask is used to further divide the IP address into two parts: network address and host address.
  - The network address identifies the subnet, while the host address identifies individual devices within that subnet.

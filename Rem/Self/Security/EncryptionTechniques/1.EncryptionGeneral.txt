Two types encryptions
1. Symmetric
  Same encryption key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data
  faster than Asymmetric
  used for larger volume of data
  AES algorithm is widely accepted
2. Asymmetric
  Public private key concept
  slower than Symmetric
  Public key is shared btn two parties, they used this to encrypt the data and private key is used to decrypt

Hashing technique
-------------------------
Another mechanism to protect the data is Hashing technique
hashing technique is used to generate the Hash for the large set of data
it is difficult to convert back the hash data
we can use this technique to save the passwords
even small change in data will generate the new hash
MD5,SHA256

 Asp.net core 2.0 uses
 AES256 for encryption
 and
 SHA256 (Hashing) for validation

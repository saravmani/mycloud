A named pipe itself is just an object in the windows kernel.
It provides access for different clients to a shared resource. A pipe is identified by its name and can be
used for one-way or duplex communication scenarios. While there may be only one pipe server,
 there may be more than one client applications using a pipe. With the NetNamedPipeBinding,
 WCF offers an abstraction to pipe objects, making it really easy to use them for inter-process communication.

 Message security is available on all of the bindings except for netNamedPipeBinding and MSmqIntegrationBinding.

#Tags - estimated plans and actual plans
when passing the query to sql server 2 things will happen
1. parsing the query - is query syntax is valid and all the objects used in that query is valid
2. Check query plan cache (which are already generated).  if it is exists then it will try to re-use it . or else i will generate one
(Generating query execution plan is a expensive process)


From 2016 sql server this query plans stored in XML format

estimated plans and actual plans
------------------------------------
there are two types of execution plans that exist in SQL Server and that you can see through Management Studio
and other related tools.
And these are estimated plans and actual plans.

Estimated Plan
---------------------
estimated plan is that you can generate an estimated plan without running the query.

Actual Plan
-------------
Actual plan has more data included with it in terms of statistics about actual versus estimated


How to read execution plan
------------------------------------
Plans are always read from right to left and top to bottom.
Size of the arrows which are conencting the objects are representative  of the amount of data flowing to next operator


Execution plans are stored in XML fromate
SSMS gives graphical view for this

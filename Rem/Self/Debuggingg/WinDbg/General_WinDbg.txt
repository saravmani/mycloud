NOTE: .NetDebugging: windbg comes with windows sdk. SOS.dll, PSSCOR4.dll

Set up windbg for 2012 r2
--------------------------
Install windows sdk from below link. (we can use windows 8's sdk)
(the good thing is that you can copy the windbg.exe to every client system and start immediately with the debugging)
opne windbg
create dump file from task manager.
drag and drop the dump file into windbg


so we can do with WinDbg. this comes with windows SDK
but windbg cant directly debug managed code.
for that we need extension called SOS. it is shipped with .Net framework

SOS and PssCor2
------------------------------
By default, WinDbg is a tool designed for unmanaged code debugging, but an extension ships with the .NET Framework called SOS.dll
 that enables managed code debugging.  An additional WinDbg extension called PssCor2 has been created that is a superset of SOS and provides additional
 functionality for managed code developers.  This extension will allow you to inspect managed threads, the managed object heap, and inspect the CLR stack,
among other things.
NOTE: .NetDebugging: PSSCOR extension is a debugger extension which is super-set of SOS.DLL. It is used for debugging .NET issues with WinDBG,
such as high memory / CPU usage, crashes, etc
PSSCOR4 for a long time in Microsoft for .NET 4.0 related issues


Ways to debugging
-----------------------------
1. Attach to running process by pressing  F6.
2. Take crash dump of the application task manager, or using debugdiag or using adplus, And load the
Crash dump file into windbg by pressing ctrl+D
3. Then load SOS by .loadby <pathtososfile>/sos.dll
4. Then we can use below commands
5. Even we can able to se the breadk point to specific class method


Command to load sos
-------------------------
.symfix
.reload
.loadby sos clr
!PrintException  // this command used to print the exception but not source code info :-(
!clrstack // Gives the source code file and line number :-)
~*e !clrstack //To fetch the stack trace of all threads (this will be usefull for debugging dump file)
!threads //gives the list of threads details
~kv t
.foreach(exc {sx}) {.catch{sxd ${exc}}}

!dumpheap // to find memory leak
!dumpheap -type Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleCommand //To filter and check memory leak of particular type


NOTE: .NetDebugging: (the good thing is that you can copy the windbg.exe to every client system and start immediately with the debugging)


Issues and solution
---------------------
 *** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found. Defaulted to export symbols for



Other tools used to create dumps include using ADPlus (included in the Debugging Tools for Windows), or even DebugDiag.
 Using DebugDiag lets you create rules for when dumps are captured, such as when a particular exception is raised.
 This can be very helpful for grabbing a snapshot of memory as the error occurs so that you can troubleshoot errors in ULS logs in SharePoint.

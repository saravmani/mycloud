By default, ASP.NET Core applications do not provide any other details on status
codes, but we can enable these details by using the StatusCodePagesMiddleware. We
must call the UseStatusPages extension method available on IApplicationBuilder:
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
app.UseStatusCodePages();
}
When running the application and invoking an endpoint that does not exist, we will
get the following response formatted as plain text:
Status code page, status code: 404
We can also customize the response to our liking. For example, the following code
uses an overload of the UseStatusCodePages function, thus allowing us to write directly
to the Response stream:
app.UseStatusCodePages(async context =>
{
context.HttpContext.Response.ContentType = "text/plain";
await context.HttpContext.Response.WriteAsync(
$"Awesome Status Page, status code: {context.HttpContext.Response.
StatusCode}");
});
Now, when the application hits a Not Found error, the following will be in the
response body:
Awesome Status Page, status code: 4

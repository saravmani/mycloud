NetMSMQ
--------------
The <netMsmqBinding> is the queued binding WCF provides for two WCF endpoints to communicate using MSMQ.
The binding, therefore, exposes properties that are specific to MSMQ. However, not all MSMQ features
and properties are exposed in the NetMsmqBinding.
The compact NetMsmqBinding is designed with an optimal set of features that most customers should find sufficient.

MSMQ
----------------
MSMQ ships as an optional component with Windows and runs as an NT service.
It captures messages for transmission in a transmission queue and for delivery in a target queue.
The MSMQ queue managers implement a reliable message-transfer protocol so that messages are not lost in transmission.
The protocol can be either native or SOAP-based, such as the SOAP Reliable Message Protocol (SRMP).

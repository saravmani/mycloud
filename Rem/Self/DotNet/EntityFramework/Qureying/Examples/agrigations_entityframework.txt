Available aggrigations
Count
sum
min
max
average

It is important to understand that all the aggregate functions can be used
only in the method syntax and not in the query syntax. If we want to use
the aggregate operators in the query syntax, then we will have to use the
mixed syntax,

Count
----------------------------------
One important thing to note here is that Count has no query syntax, so if we want to
retrieve the count, we need to mix the query syntax, and use Count as the method
syntax.

int numberEmployees = (from employee in db.Employees
where employee.Employer_ID == 4
select employee).Count();

In the preceding code, we first retrieved a list of Employees whose Employer_ID is 4.
We executed the Count function on the query that will effectively return the number
of Employees with Employer_ID as 4

SELECT
[GroupBy1].[A1] AS [C1]
FROM ( SELECT
COUNT(1) AS [A1]
FROM [dbo].[Employees] AS [Extent1]
WHERE 4 = [Extent1].[Employer_ID]
) AS [GroupBy1]

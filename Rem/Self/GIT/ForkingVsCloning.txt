Forking creates your own copy of a repository in a remote location (for example, GitHub). Your own copy means that you will be able to contribute changes to your copy of the repository without affecting the original repository.

Cloning makes a local copy of a repository, not your own copy. Think of it as downloading a repository onto your local hard drive. Unlike forks, clones have references to their original repositories.

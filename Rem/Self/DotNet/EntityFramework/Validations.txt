Entity Framework will perform the validation on the annotations.
#Need to check this

We can use fluent API instead of annotations to get the same client side &
server side validation.
Fluent API configurations are applied as code first is building the model
from the classes. You can inject the configurations by overriding the
DbContext class' OnModelCreating method.

Ex:
public class BlogContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Post> Posts { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Comment> Comments { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<Blog>().Property(p => p.BloggerName).HasMaxLength(10);
    }
}

Validation errors thrown based on the Fluent API configurations will not
automatically reach the UI, 
but you can capture it in code and then respond to it accordingly.

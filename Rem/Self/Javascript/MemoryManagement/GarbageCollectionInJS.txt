The main notion garbage collection algorithms rely on is the notion of reference. 
Within the context of memory management, an object is said 
to reference another object if the former has an access to the latter 
(either implicitly or explicitly). 
JavaScript object has a reference to its prototype (implicit reference) 
and to its properties values (explicit reference).

(In JavaScript, the root is the global object)

emitDecoratorMetadata and experimentalDecorators enable the use of annotations such as @Component
target: 'es5' means that the output of the compilation is just plain Javascript, instead of for example ES6
module: 'commonjs' means that each file will be exported as a separate CommonJs module. for example HelloWorld.tswill be converted into an isolated module
moduleResolution: 'node' ensure that the import paths will work exactly the same way in the browser as in a node runtime
outDir is where the output of the Typescript compiler is saved
sourcemap: true triggers the generation of source maps
declaration: true triggers the generation of the typings *.d.ts files, that enable IDE Intellisense

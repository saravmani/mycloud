we can tell sone specific FOLER path to look for export methods. 




What if we wanted to substitute out the implementation of B for MockB during testing?
• What if we wanted to share a single instance of the B class across our whole app (e.g. the
Singleton pattern)
• What if we wanted to create a new instance of the B class every time it was used? (e.g. the
Factory pattern)

Dependency Injection can solve these problems.

It is a subset of AI
AI, Machine Learning, Deep learning are different stuffs

Machine learning are having 3 different categories
1. Re-Inforcement Learning
2. Supervised Learning
3. Un-Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning
  a superwiser will train the model that, based on input wethere output is correct or not. if not correct superwiser will correct it.
This process will go on untill, the model gives accurate result in acceptable level.
Ex: if we upload a picture of duck's different images it should identify it as  a duck

Un - supervised learning
  there is no exact output required. there is no superviser to tell that which is correct output. based on the input it will gives output with interesting
  patterns in the data. without past knowledge it will produce output
  Ex1:Based on input data, based on the pattern in the data it produces output by group of characters


Deep learning algorithms require - large data, high end machines, GPU etc.,

NOTE: multi-level hierarchy; File, Commandline, environment variables; deserialize to custom poco;
The Configuration API provides a way to configure an ASP.NET Core web app based on a list of name-value pairs.
Configuration is read at runtime from multiple sources. Name-value pairs can be grouped into a multi-level hierarchy.

There are configuration providers for:
--------------------------------------------------
File formats (INI, JSON, and XML).
Command-line arguments.
Environment variables.
In-memory .NET objects.
The unencrypted Secret Manager storage.
An encrypted user store, such as Azure Key Vault.
Custom providers (installed or created).


Each configuration value maps to a string key.
There's built-in binding support to deserialize settings into a custom POCO object (a simple .NET class with properties).

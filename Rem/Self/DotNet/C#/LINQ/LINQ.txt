    In LINQ, domain-specific queries (like LINQ to SQL, LINQ to Entity) are result into IQueryable<T> type.
The C# and Visual Basic compilers compile these queries into code that builds an expression trees at runtime.
Then query provider traverse the expression tree and translate it
into a query language (like T-SQL) which is appropriate for that data source.

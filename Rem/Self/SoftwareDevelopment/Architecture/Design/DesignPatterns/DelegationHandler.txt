I have seen this pattern in WEBAPI's Message Handlers
Typically, a series of message handlers are chained together.
 The first handler receives an HTTP request, does some processing,
  and gives the request to the next handler. At some point, the response is 
  created and goes back up the chain. This pattern is called a delegating handler.

#### Dependency Inverison Principle
###### Understanding Dependency Inverison Principle
>
High-level modules (Classe/ Components) should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (Mostly interfaces).

In Below example HighLevelClass class depends on Interface-A. LowLevelConcreteClass also dependes on Interface-A. There is no direct link between high level class and low level class

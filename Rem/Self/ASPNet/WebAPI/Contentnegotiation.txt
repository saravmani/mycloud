The HTTP specification (RFC 2616) defines content negotiation as
“the process of selecting the best representation for a given response
when there are multiple representations available.” The primary mechanism for content negotiation in HTTP
are these request headers:

Accept: Which media types are acceptable for the response, such as “application/json,” “application/xml,”
  or a custom media type such as "application/vnd.example+xml"
Accept-Charset: Which character sets are acceptable, such as UTF-8 or ISO 8859-1.
Accept-Encoding: Which content encodings are acceptable, such as gzip.
Accept-Language: The preferred natural language, such as “en-us”.

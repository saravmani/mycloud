The HttpConfiguration.Services collection contains a set of global services that Web API uses to perform various tasks, such as 
controller selection and content negotiation

The Services collection is initialized with a default set of services, and you can provide your own custom implementations. Some services support multiple instances, while others can have only one instance. (However, you can also provide services at the controller level; 
using Per-Controller Configuration.

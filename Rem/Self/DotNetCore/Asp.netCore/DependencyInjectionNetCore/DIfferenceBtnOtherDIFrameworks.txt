Asp.net core contains built in dependency injection support.
Like other DI frameworks, built in Asp.net DI framework WONT support
: Auto-Discovery, Auto-Registrations, Decorators or Injectors, or convention based registrations.
There are also no plans to add this to the built-in container yet as far as I know.

If we need to property injection, Auto-Registrations, Decorators or Injectors then we have to go for
third party injectors.

# My commands
But Property injection is bad idea, bcs there is no guarantee that property will get injected
Also unit test cases also will get affected, if the property injection not happened properly

ASP.NET Core implementation doesn’t support is the ability to map the same abstract type to
multiple concrete types—each with a different and unique key.
By passing the key (usually, an arbitrary string) to the service provider, 
you can have the abstract type resolved in a particular way.

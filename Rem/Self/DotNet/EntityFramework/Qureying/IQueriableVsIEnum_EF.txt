While using LINQ to Entities, it is important to understand when
to use IEnumerable and IQueryable. If we use IEnumerable,
the query will be executed immediately. If we use IQueryable, the
query execution will be deferred until the application requests the
enumeration.
Now let's see what should be considered while deciding whether to
use IQueryable or IEnumerable. Using IQueryable gives you
a chance to create a complex LINQ query using multiple statements
without executing the query at the database level. The query gets
executed only when the final LINQ query gets enumerated.

Handling results in IQueryable<T> also improves the performance,
as the generated SQL will not be executed until the items from the
result are enumerated.

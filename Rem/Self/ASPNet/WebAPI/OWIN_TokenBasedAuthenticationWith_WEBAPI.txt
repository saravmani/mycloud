The Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN) defines a standard interface between .NET web servers and web applications.
Katana is open-source components for building and hosting OWIN-based web applications.
It provides the implementation of the OWIN specification.

Every OWIN application has a start-up class in which we specify components for the application pipeline.


Benefits of token based authentication system

Scalability of Servers
the token itself contains all the information of the user that is needed for authentication,
so Web Farm extension is an easy task. There is no dependence on shared session stores.

Loosely Coupling
Our front-end application is not coupled with a specific authentication mechanism.
The token is generated from the server and our web API has a built-in way to understand this token and perform authentication.

Mobile Friendly
This type of authentication does not require cookies, so this authentication type can be used with mobile applications.



install below nuget packages
------------------------------
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Owin
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb


PM> Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework
ASP.NET Identity also supports the Entity Framework. Here we will use ASP.Net identity with Entity Framework,
so we need to install this via Nuget packages.

#As per my understanding mixins are used for multiple inheritance. js will not support multiple inheritance
so, we are adding other classes properties into child class by using prototype binding
# refer typescript mixins

by using mixins we can able to combine lots of functionalities of small classes into
bigger ONE class

Along with traditional OO hierarchies, another popular way of building up classes
from reusable components is to build them by combining simpler partial classes.
You may be familiar with the idea of mixins or traits for languages like Scala, and
the pattern has also reached some popularity in the JavaScript community.

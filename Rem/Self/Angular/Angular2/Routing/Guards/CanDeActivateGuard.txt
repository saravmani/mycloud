 While deactivating route using CanDeactivate guard, we need to open a Confirmation Dialog Box to take user confirmation if user wants to stay on the page or leave the page.


CanDeactivate guard can be used in the scenario, for example, suppose a user is changing form data and before saving, user tries to navigate away. In this scenario we can use CanDeactivate guard which will deactivate the route and open a Dialog Box to take user confirmation.


# i think we have to create a utility method with confirm dialogue box.. and use with guards

Savepoints
Savepoints are sort of markers that help in splitting a long transaction into smaller units by setting some checkpoints. 
SAVEPOINT < savepoint_name >;

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) 
VALUES (7, 'Rajnish', 27, 'HP', 9500.00 ); 

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) 
VALUES (8, 'Riddhi', 21, 'WB', 4500.00 ); 
SAVEPOINT sav1;
  
UPDATE CUSTOMERS 
SET SALARY = SALARY + 1000; 
ROLLBACK TO sav1;
  
UPDATE CUSTOMERS 
SET SALARY = SALARY + 1000 
WHERE ID = 7; 
UPDATE CUSTOMERS 
SET SALARY = SALARY + 1000

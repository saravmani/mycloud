Finalize
---------------
there is not keyword called finalize.
in c# we can implement finalize by writing destractor

class a
{
~a()
{}
}
#when we compile this code... destractor will converted into finalize
in c# using destractor we are implementing finalize. 
If we check it in reflector, we can able to see Finalize():void method.


#when garbage collectors, if it finds the object which implements destractor  
it will move it to finalize queue.
but we are not sure when this queue will looked 

This   method is called when the garbage collector determines that the object is garbage
and before the memory for the object is reclaimed.


Destructor or finalize
------------------------
.Net Framework will try to run all finalizers, but there is no guaranty that they ever be executed.


The C# automatically generated finalizer chaining does call Dispose(bool) multiple times, 
which is why it is especially important to implement the pattern only once in the inheritance chain.

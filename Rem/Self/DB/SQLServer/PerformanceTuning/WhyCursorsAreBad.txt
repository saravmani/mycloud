cursor does is iterates through each record one at a time,
Cursors will do  row-based processing (not set based operation)

If we are joining two tables then Set-Based operation is happening. so performance will be good

Row-Based processing will not scale
But Set-Based processing will scale
## my understanding is , set based processing will use the multi threading, to scale up. But not Sure


While loops are faster than cursors?
No. both are row-based processing. so it is not true. Only advantage of while loop is syntax wise simple

Instead of while loop we can prefer cursors.. why?
If you absolutely need to do something in a row by row fashion, you're better off using a cursor,
mainly because with a cursor you have a couple of options. You have the way you can read cursors and memory. 
You can control a little bit better so you can better organize for your situation.


What can we do instead of cursors?
try doing whatever operations you can in a set-based operation. It's always better to join two tables or
even if you have to create a temp table and write a lot of records.
Sequel server and databases in general in this comprise well beyond sequel server are very effective at
joining tables and writing large volumes of data from a table so they're really good
at doing this large sorts of operations especially when you have proper indexing on the columns you need.

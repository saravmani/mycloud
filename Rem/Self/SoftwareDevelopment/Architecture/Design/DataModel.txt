Conceptual, Logical and Physical Data Model

Conceptual, logical and physical model or ERD are three different ways 
of modeling data in a domain. While they all contain entities and relationships, 
they differ in the purposes they are created for and 
audiences they are meant to target. 
A general understanding to the three models is that,

business analyst uses conceptual and logical model for modeling the 
data required and produced by system from a business angle, 
while database designer refines the early design to produce 
the physical model for presenting physical database structure 
ready for database construction.


Logical ERD also models information gathered from business requirements. 
It is more complex than conceptual model in that column types are set. 
Note that the setting of column types is optional and if you do that, 
you should be doing that to aid business analysis. 
It has nothing to do with database creation yet.



Physical Model
Physical ERD represents the actual design blueprint of a relational database. 
It represents how data should be structured and related in a specific DBMS so it is 
important to consider the convention and restriction of the DBMS you use when you are 
designing a physical ERD. This means that an accurate use of data type is needed for 
entity columns and the use of reserved words has to be avoided in naming entities and columns. 
Besides, database designers may also add primary keys, 
foreign keys and constraints to the design.

for Proper encoding to browser understand mention following line. 
<meta charset="utf-8">

HTML5 Standard: Unicode UTF-8

If we want latest HTML5 features, or any older featues, then we have to tell browsers that which 
rendering engine it should use. Below meta tag tells Internet Explorer that use latest edge RENDERING ENGINE.
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge;chrome=1" >
If not mention this then browser will try to find which rendering engine it should use to render the page
by seeing tags like <!DOCTYPE html> etc.,

Where ever possible try to use CDN.
Advantages of CDN is
1. Jquery, Bootstraps are used by many websites from CDN. so if our website also
uses CDN, then already cached files (when users already used in other websites), 
will be loaded from browser itself

# my idea - Check the fiddler how many calls are going to server in each page navigation
it should be less number
# my idea - number of css, js references should be less. so have to use 
bundling

we can use yslow pluggin

Security checks like 
anitiforgery token,
Validate the Headers in fiddler 
    XSS header, CORS header, mime types, Is there any server tags

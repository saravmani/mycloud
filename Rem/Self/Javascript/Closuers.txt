Closures
-------------
# js having lexical scoping. whcih means inside varaible not accessible outside.
 but outside one will be accessible insides

closers = functions with preserved data 
# closure means bundle the variable with function. so that we can use it anytime. 
ex:
function mainfn(passParam){
    return function subFn()
    {
        return 3+passParam;// this will be passed and become closer for subFn
    }
}

var obj1 = new mainfn(2);
var obj2 = new mainfn(3);
console.log(obj1());
//It preserves the values inside the function as a property

//console.dir(fnName);// this will tell about the closer details associated with particular function

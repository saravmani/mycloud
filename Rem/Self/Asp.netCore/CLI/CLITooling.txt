dotnet  is the cli tooling.

Commands for tooling
------------------------

dotnet
  --version //.NET CLI version number
  --help
  --info //Displays information about the runtime environment and the .NET CLI

## my understanding is - there are two main parts in .net core
one is CLI (only for tooling), another one is CLR (Runtime)

dotnet <command> --help //used to get the details help about commands
dotnet new projname

dotnet run
dotnet restore //restore dependencies
//#it is like npm install i think
dotnet build
dotnet msbuild //runs microsoft build engine

dotnet test - Runs unit tests in the project using the configured test runner. Unit tests are class libraries with a dependency on a particular unit test framework and its runner application.

dotnet publish
dotnet pack - creates nuget package

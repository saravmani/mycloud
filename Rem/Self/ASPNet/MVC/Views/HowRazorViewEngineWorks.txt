The Razor View Engine compiles the views in your applications to improve performance. The views are translated into
C# classes, and then compiled, which is why you are able to include C# code fragments so easily


The views in an MVC application are not compiled until the application is started, so to see the classes that are
created by Razor, you need to start the application and navigate to the /Home/Index action. 

The initial request to MVC  application triggers the compilation process for all views.

classes generated from the view files are written to the disk as C# code files and then compiled,
which means that you can see the C# statements that represent a view. 

You can find the generated files in  
c:\Users\<yourLoginName>\AppData\Local\Temp\Temporary ASP.NET Files on Windows 7 and Windows 8.
Finding the code file generated for a particular view requires a bit of poking around. There are usually a number of
folders with cryptic names, and the names of the .cs files do not correspond to the names of the classes they contain.
As an example, I found the generated class for the view in Listing 20-10 in a file called App_Web_ihpp0d0l.0.cs in the
root\7bbfc2bc\bd7485cd folder


As you now know, Razor is not really looking for the view files on disk, because they have already been compiled
into C# classes. Razor looks for the compiled class that represents these views.

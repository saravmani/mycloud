Require Android studio
Android studio -> tools -> SDK Manager
  API Level >23 should be installed


Once everything installed from Android studio

run below command in ur proj
ionic capacitor add android
  // before doing this you should build the application once

ionic capacitor copy android // this command shoudl be executed after done build
// this command will copy the www folder to andorid folder to bundle it

ionic capacitor run android
// this will do below steps automatically
  //1. build, 2. copy www folder ,
    3. open the proj in android studio

once proj opened in android studio then
android studio will automatically download if any required items

so first time it will take some time

now run emulator

Once emulator started go to
Android studio and run the application

ionic capacitor run android -l // this will automatically updates the app in device (mobile or emulator). we will
get same feel like browser

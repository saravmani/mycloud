I have hosted asp.net core application with full framework (i done this POC with asp.net core FULL FRAMEWORK (4.7.1))
1. I downloaded and installed "Microsoft .Net Core Windows Server Hosting"
2. Then published the asp.net core application from vsts to a Folder
3. Then configured that folder in IIS with new Applicaiton pool (.Net version Non Managed Code)

And IT is working :-)

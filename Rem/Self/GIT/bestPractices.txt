1. While committing give short comments (lessthan 50 is preferable).
If more comments needed then add multi line comments as each line lessthan 70
bcs git can be used by mobile or other tools. to view the full comments shorter length comment needed

2. comments should be in present tens
ex: it should be - "Fixes for button disable error <reference number>"
    it should not be = "Fixed the bug button disable error"

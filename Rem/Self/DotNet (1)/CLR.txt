The core features of the CLR (such as memory management,
assembly loading, security, exception handling, and thread synchronization)
any language which is poing to CLR will get above mentioined features.

at runtime, the CLR has no idea which programming language the developer used

Source code will be compiled into PE32(for 32 bit portable executable) or PE32+

managed assemblies always take advantage of Data Execution Prevention
(DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) in Windows; these two features improve the
security of your whole system.

Parts of Managed Module
---------------------------
PE Header (standard windows PE file header) - has file type (GUI,CUI or DLL), Time stamp (build time)
	Note: For modules that contain 	native CPU code, this header contains information about the native CPU code
CLR Header -CLR version required, Entry point, Loacation information of metadata, resources, strong names etc.,,,,
Meta Data - two main types of tables:
		tables that describe the types and members defined in your source code and tables that
		describe the types and members referenced by your source code.
IL Code - Code the compiler produced as it compiled the source code. At run time, the CLR compiles
	  the IL into native CPU instructions.

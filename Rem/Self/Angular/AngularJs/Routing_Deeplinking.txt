Deep Linking
-------------------------
To create more complex applications, we can split up our code into different sections through something called deep linking.
Now, this is the process of making different URLs load up different content.
And this content can be managed by different code in your application. Deep linking is handled through something called ngRoute.
This is a different module that we'll have to load into our application using a different JavaScript file.
Once we load that up, we can configure our application through something called the route provider.

Now this module works with a special directive called ng-view.

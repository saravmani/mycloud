Install ionic essentials extension manager for vs code.
it will give u intellisence on html page with components list


ion-route-outlet
this is wrapper around angular route-outlet component.
it adds styling and smooth navigation features


ionic-avatar - this will display image in rounded shape.
        this will load the image when within view port. otherwise it will not load.
        We can use text also inside of avatar
ionic-thumbnail - same like avatar but displays in square format


ion-grid - uses css Flexbox under the hood
  <ion-grid>
    <ion-row>
      <ion-col size="12">

<ion-grid fixed> //then grid will be fixed with. not flexible



<ion-Item> is mandatory inside of <ion-List> but. we can use ion-item outside of ion-List also

<ion-virtual-scroll> used for virtual scrolling
#in Udemy i have created bookmark for this
# bookmark text - How to add Virtual  scrolling

<ion-image> try to use ion-image as much as possible. bcs it will take care of lazy loading. when required that time
only images will get rendered. also this will work with ion-virtual-scroll automatically


ActionSheet - this control will give more actionable items from bottom up
it is good to provide more options for the users (it is alternative to popup)
(it is like slider panel)

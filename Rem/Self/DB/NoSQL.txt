NO SQL
----------
nonrelational DBMSs are called no sql or not only sql.
Performac.

Although relational DBMSs sacrifice performance for reliability, many NoSQL databases
put performance first. For this reason, NoSQL databases may be a better choice
for real-time analytics or messaging. NoSQL databases also usually donâ€™t require data
schemas to be predefined, which is useful for applications in which stored data is hierarchical
but whose hierarchy varies.

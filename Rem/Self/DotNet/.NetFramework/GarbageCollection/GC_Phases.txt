Garbage Collector Working Phase
-------------------------------------------


Marking Phase
-------------------------------
In this phase garbage collector finds and creates a list of all live objects.

Relocating Phase
--------------------------
In this phase garbage collector updates the references to the objects that will be compacted.

Compacting Phase
-----------------------
In this phase garbage collector reclaims the memory occupied by the dead objects 
and compacts the surviving objects. The compacting phase moves the surviving objects 
toward the older end of the memory segment.

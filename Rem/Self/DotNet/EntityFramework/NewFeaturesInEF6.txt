New Features in Entity framework 6
------------------------------------------
        With Entity Framework 6 onwards, Entity Framework provides the Database.
BeginTransaction() method on the DbContext object. This is particularly useful
when we want to execute raw SQL commands using our context class and associate
them with transactions.

Database.UseTransaction()
---------------------------------
If we want to use Entity Framework with any legacy application that demands
SqlTransaction, then we should use the Database.UseTransaction()
method, which is also available in Entity Framework 6.

EF6 is open source

EF6.1.3 - released in March 10 2015

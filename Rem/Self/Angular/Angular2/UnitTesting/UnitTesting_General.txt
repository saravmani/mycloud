There are two type of tests
1. Unit testing
2. End to End testing

karma - Test runner we can use jasmin for unit testing

protractor - For end to end testing for angular js (written by angular team). 
It used with Jasmin

wallaby js.. used to get feed back on IDE (test results on screen)

.spec.ts files is testing file



Some Angular building blocks, such as pipes and services, can be readily tested in 
isolation using the basic testing tools

Components (and, to a lesser extent, directives) have complex
interactions with their host elements and with their template content and require special 
features for unit testing

Test Bed
----------
Angular provides a test bed that allows a realistic application
environment to be created and then used to perform unit tests

It can take some time and effort to get to the point where unit tests are
easily written and run and you are sure that you have isolated the
correct part of the application for testing.

# we should isolate the part, to do the unit testing


Use the DebugElement class to query the component’s
template. Trigger the events using the debug element


Perfom the test which relies on asynchronous operations
--------------------------------------------------------------
Use the whenStable method to defer the test until the
effect of the operation has been processed.


Tips to test directives
----------------------------
Create a test component whose template applies the directive under test.

Why unit testing required? do we need to really implement unit testing for ALL the features?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I tend to focus on writing unit tests for features and functions that I know will be hard to
write and that are likely to be the source of bugs in deployment. 
In these situations, unit testing helps
structure my thoughts about how to best implement what I need. I find that just thinking about what I
need to test helps produce ideas about potential problems, 
and that’s before I start dealing with actual bugs and defects.


Unit testing are not required for creation of new code. It is required for regression testing


we can keep unit test files seperately.. in seperate folder

Querying Template Content
==============================
Components can query the content of their templates to locate instances of directives or components, 
which are known as view children. These are similar to the directive content children queries

  @ViewChildren(PaCellColor)  viewChildren: QueryList<PaCellColor>;
  ngAfterViewInit() {
    this.viewChildren.changes.subscribe(() => {
      //some work
    });
  }

I implement the ngAfterViewInit method to ensure that Angular has processed the
component’s template and set the result of the query. 
Within the method I perform the initial call to the updateViewChildren method,


  There are two property decorators that are used to query for directives or components

  @ViewChild(class) - This decorator tells Angular to query for the first directive or component. 
  Multiple classes or templates can be separated by commas.

@ViewChildren(class) - this returns QueryList Collection of objects


ngAfterViewInit  - The results of the view queries are set before this method is invoked.

# i guess QueryList.changes property, is will called when new child component added

Angular components are compiled into factory classes, either within the browser or by the Ahead-of-
Time compiler that I demonstrated in Chapter 10. As part of this process, Angular processes any external
templates and includes them as text in the JavaScript code that is generated similar 
to an inline template.
When unit testing a component with an external template, the compilation step must be performed
explicitly.

Components are compiled using the TestBed.compileComponents method. The compilation process
is asynchronous, and the compileComponents method returns a Promise, which must be used to complete
the test setup when the compilation is complete. To make it easier to work with asynchronous operations
in unit tests, the @angular/core/testing module contains a function called async, 
which is used with the beforeEach method.


beforeEach(async(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [
        AppComponent
      ],
    }).compileComponents();
  }));

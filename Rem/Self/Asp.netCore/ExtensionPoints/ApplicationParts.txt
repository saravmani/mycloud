# used to create seperate projects (dlls) with controllers, and we can able to use those controllers in the main applciation
using applicatin part

By using application parts, we make it possible
to discover external components to be used in our application that can even be located
in a separate assembly.

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    var assembly = Assembly.LoadFile(@"C:\folder\mylib.dll");
    services.AddMvc()
    .AddApplicationPart(assembly);
}

Letâ€™s assume we have a compiled class library that contains a specific controller
called PeopleController, which returns a list of people names and is situated within a
particular folder on the server. We can make use of the AddApplicationPart extension
method to add application parts from a given assembly during runtime.

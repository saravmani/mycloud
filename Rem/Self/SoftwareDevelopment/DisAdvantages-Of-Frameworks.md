# Disadvantages of Software frameworks
###### Most of the frameworks are helpful for developpers to fast track their development. But still there are some disadvantages
>
1. They are bulky. If we need one small feature of that framework then we need to include whole framework to use that (But now a days many framews are modular)
2. Sometimes frameworks are restrict the developpers to go beond or break the framework boundary. Bcs most of the frameworks will provide the hooks only for important and required places

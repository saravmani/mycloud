Synchronoised method
----------------------------
Attribute
If an entire method is a critical section, applying a MethodImplAttribute with the MethodImplOptions
value of Synchronized wraps the entire method in a lock.

lock is syntactical sugar simplifying the use of .Net's Monitor exclusive lock.

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized)]
public void DoSomething()
{
    // Code
}
If the method is an instance method, the current object instance is used as the locking object;
if the method is static, the class type object is used.
If the lock object used is publicly accessible, code elsewhere could also lock using the same object
The potential result?
Unnecessary and unexpected deadlocking your code.
A best practice (see also) is to only lock on a private object or a private static object variable.
This attribute-based approach, if used at all, must be used carefully to prevent
inadvertent violation of this best practice.

buffer is temperoray storage . when buffer is filled then it will be flushed.
stream of data pushed into buffer.


we can stream the data usign streams in node.js


writable streams  - allow nodejs to write data to a stream
readable streams - allow nodejs to read data from a stream
duplex stream  - can do both



var fs = require('fs');
var objReadStream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname+"/filename.txt","utf8");//__dirname tells current directory
//read stream already inherited from events. so this will have event emiter option.

objReadStream.on('read',function(chunk){
console.log(chunk);//now data will be readed as chunk by chunk
});

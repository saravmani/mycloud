app.Use(async (httpContext, next) =>

httpContext.Items["value"] = value;//## this one used to set and pass some data to next pipeline

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env,IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }

        app.Run(async (context) =>
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello Wereorldss!"+configuration["TestKeyName"]);
        });
    }
This is the place where we can configure middlewares

Logger,
Authorizer
Router,
Static file server,
MVC (if we need MVC frame work then we need to register group of services required for MVC framework),
etc.,

Order of the middleware is important.

MVC itself is a middleware

Each middlewares can handle the request and response both
each middleware can choose wether they can pass the request other middleware or not

-------------------
You'll find that 64bit windows keeps two copies of system executables. There's c:\windows\system32 for 64bit apps, and "c:\windows\syswow64" for the 32bit versions.
Navigate to the syswow64 folder and look for taskmgr.exe, double click it to run the 32bit version, after task manager opens you will notice "taskmgr.exe*32" in the list, any process in the list with *32 means it is a 32bit version running.

.NET Framework exceptionhandling
mechanism is built using the Structured Exception Handling (SEH) mechanism offered by
Windows. 


in .net catch block with out any catch type 
 is equivalent to having a catch block that specifies a catch type
of System.Exception 

Note:
$exception
When debugging through a catch block by using Microsoft Visual Studio, you can
see the currently thrown exception object by adding the special $exception variable name
to a watch window.

NOte: we can able to modify the catch block parameter-- But i m not suere. we have to test it
catch(Exception ex)
{
here ex is not read only we can able to modify it. But i m not suere. we have to test it
}

webservice host and service host
--------------------------------
The WebServiceHost class is based on the ServiceHost class.
It comes with WebHttpBinding and WebHttpBehavior by default. (The nice thing is you don't need a configuration file, for simple use.)

Uri baseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:8080/test");
ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(TestService), baseAddress);
host.Open();

Uri baseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:8080/test");
WebServiceHost host = new WebServiceHost(typeof(TestService), baseAddress);
host.Open();

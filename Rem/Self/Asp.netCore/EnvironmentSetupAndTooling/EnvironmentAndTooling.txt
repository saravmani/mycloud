For .net core 2.0 need Visual studio 2017 update 15.5
It is having .csproj and MsBuild

.csproj is very simple.
In older versions we have to specify the .cs files in the .csproj file. 
then only it will take for build
But now in asp.net core what ever cs files available in folder it will take for build

Microsoft.AspNetCore.All // is  a base package
//it is META PACKAGE. this brings other packages    

No global.asax, no web.config

By default Process will be using Kestrol to run the application.
We can able to Configure IIS which will pass the requests to Kestorl if we want to 
server for Intra net clients


default Configurations
-------------------------------
Kestorl
Default Logging (uses console, or Ouput window of Visual studio Based on tooling)

IConfiguration - object will available throughout the application. 
using this we can able to access the configuration information
By default configuration service will read data from appsettings.json file. 
Also From User secrets.
We can able to do configuration using Environment variables, and through command line


.net core ships with 2 http servers.
WebListner - Windows only
Kestorl - Cross platform

Asp.net core is completely decoupled from webserver which is hosting the application


In production to deploy our applicaiton on Windows Server
We can use IIS server as proxy server, for Kestorl. IIs will transfer the calls to Kestrol
For Linux
We can try different servers. one is Appachie server. We can use this as Proxy for Kestrol

Advantages of Hosting in IIS 
------------------------------------
Restart the application if it crash
Manage SSL layer part
many more...


If we modify any settings in launchsettings, 
then we have to restart Kestrol, or iisexpress or visual studio

JavaScript runs in a single-threaded environment. Timers, then, simply schedule code execution
to happen at some point in the future. The timing of execution is not guaranteed, because other
code may control the JavaScript process at different times during the page life cycle.
Once the page downloaded, javascript process will run the initial code which is there in
<script>tag. after that JavaScript process waits for more code to execute.
In this waiting time, if any events raised or any ajax callback happend.. then js process will execute the code immediatly.

When a button is clicked, for example, its event handler
code is added to the queue and executed at the next possible moment. When an Ajax response is
received, the callback function code is added to the queue. 
******No code is executed immediately in
JavaScript; it is executed as soon as the process is idle.

Timers work with this queue by inserting code when a particular amount of time has passed. Note
that adding code to the queue doesn�t mean it�s executed immediately;

setTimeout("code",150) means that the code will be added to the queue in
150 milliseconds. It s not meaning that code will execute in 150 ms.

When the execution of one set of code is complete, the JavaScript process yields for a short amount
of time so that other processes on the page can be executed. Since the JavaScript process blocks
other page processes, these small breaks are necessary to prevent the user interface from locking
(which can still happen during long-running code).


setInterval()
When using setInterval(), timer code is added to the queue only if there are no other instances of
the timer code already in the queue (this may happen if there was any long running function). This ensures that the time between additions of the timer code
to the queue is, at a minimum, the specifi ed interval.
So developers no need to worry about short interval adding.bcs js engine smart enough that once the 
existing function completed, then only add another timee in the queue.

Bcs of this two problems may happen
1. intervals may skipped
2. intervals may be smaller than expected. 

to avoid this we can go with chained setTimeout
setTimeout(function(){
//processing
setTimeout(arguments.callee, interval);
}, interval);

The advantage is that new timer code isn't inserted
into the queue until the previous timer code has been executed

This pattern (chain of setTimeout) is most commonly used, to exeute particular function in 
specific intervals. Also this pattern used in animation.

Each browser window, tab, or frame has its own code execution queue.
This
means that the timing of cross-frame or cross-window JavaScript calls may
result in race conditions when code is executed synchronously. Whenever this
type of communication is necessary, it's a good idea to create a timer on the
receiving frame or window to execute the code.



Yielding processes
-------------------
JavaScript running in a browser has a finite amount of resources allocated to it.
But desk top applications can command the resources. but js cant.

JavaScript is severely restricted to ensure that malicious web programmers can't
bring down a user's computer. One of these restrictions is the long-running script limit, which
prevents code from running if it takes longer than a certain amount of time or a certain number of
statements.
If you reach that limit, the user is presented with a browser error dialog indicating that
a script is taking too long to execute and asking whether the user would like to allow it to continue
processing or stop. It's the goal of all JavaScript developers to ensure that the user never sees this
confusing message from the browser. Timers are one way to work around this limitation.

Below lines of code may cause this problem.
for (var i=0, len=data.length; i < len; i++){
process(data[i]);
}
you can split the loop using timers. This is a technique called
array chunking.

setTimeout(function(){
//get next item and process it
var item = array.shift();
process(item);
//if there�s more items, set another timeout
if(array.length > 0){
setTimeout(arguments.callee, 100);//as this is anonymus function, we are using calee .. property to call the function again.
}
}, 100);


a common method 
function chunk(array, process, context){
setTimeout(function(){
var item = array.shift();
process.call(context, item);
if (array.length > 0){
setTimeout(arguments.callee, 100);
}
}, 100);
}
we set the time limit based on the need. but most of the casess 100 ms will works.
It frees process to handle ui related events.

here if we pass the array object, array object will get modified inside the chunck funciton.
if we want to keep original seperatly we can do cloning the array object.

var copyarray = arrayobject.concat();

Whenever you have a function that takes over 50 milliseconds to complete, it�s
best to see if you can split up the job into a number of smaller ones that can be
used with timers.




context of the function used in setTimeout() is always window,
So we need to set the context explicitly



Function Throttling
--------------------------
we used this in subject page's auto complete name search.
Here once user enters key, js before making call to server, if user enters
second key, then previous timer call will be canceled.

Attempting
to perform too many DOM-related operations in sequence can cause the browser to hang.
Example onresize event handler. writing dom manupulations within this event, browser can get crashed.
to avoid this we can throttle the function.

function throttle(method, context) {
clearTimeout(method.tId);
method.tId= setTimeout(function(){
method.call(context);
}, 100);
}

If you are changing
the layout of the page based on this event, it is best to throttle the processing to ensure that the
browser doesn�t do too many calculations in a short period of time

function resizeDiv(){
var div = document.getElementById(�myDiv�);
div.style.height = div.offsetWidth + �px�;
}
window.onresize = function(){
throttle(resizeDiv);
};

Throttling should be used whenever there is code that should be executed only periodically,
but you cannot control the rate at which the execution is requested













Function binding / Function bound
------------------------------------
Function binding
involves creating a function that calls another function with a specific this value and with specific
arguments.

example:
var handler = {
message: 'Event handled',
handleClick: function(event){
alert(this.message);
}
};
var btn = document.getElementById(�my-btn�);
EventUtil.addHandler(btn, �click�, handler.handleClick);

Here output is actually displays �undefined�. The problem is that the context of handler.handleClick() is
not being saved, so the this object ends up pointing to the DOM button instead of handler in most
browsers.

To solve this prblem with closure .
var btn = document.getElementById(�my-btn�);
EventUtil.addHandler(btn, �click�, function(event){
handler.handleClick(event);
});

But problem here is , code complexity. If we use more binding then code readability will be less.
to solve this we can create one common binding function and we can use it.

function bind(fn,context)
{
return functon(){
return fn.apply(context,arguments);
}
}
var btn = document.getElementById(�my-btn�);
EventUtil.addHandler(btn, �click�, bind(handler.handleClick, handler));

the bind() function is used to create a function that can be passed into
EventUtil.addHandler(), maintaining the context.

ECMA5 we can directly use like this
var btn = document.getElementById(�my-btn�);
EventUtil.addHandler(btn, �click�, handler.handleClick.bind(handler));
//bind is introduced in ECMA5

Bound functions are useful whenever a function pointer must be passed as a value and that function
needs to be executed in a particular context.
This bound functions mostly used in event handlers and setTimeout and setIntervalfunctions. 
but bound functions will consumer more memory, and slow.. so try to use when actually it is required.


With
-------------
with(location){
var qs = search.substring(1);
var hostName = hostname;
var url = href;
}

By convention, constructor
functions always begin with an uppercase letter

Check the custome object type by following syntax
alert(objectName.constructor == FunctionName); //true
alert(person1 instanceof Object); //true
alert(person1 instanceof Person); //true


alert("propertyName" in objectName)// returns boolean

function having two objects inside
1. this
2. arguments

function having two properties inside
1. prototype
2. length // tells the number of arguments passed to the function

function having below default methods. those are used to execute the function in sepcific context
1. apply//here we can pass areguments property directly(parent functions arguments)
2. call// here we have to pass parameters manually
3. bind()//ecma 5


check variable type
var obj = "rewrew";
alert(obj instanceof String); //true//string is passed into the Object constructor, an instance of String is created;

var person = {
name : �Nicholas�,
age : 29
};

above and below are same
var person = new Object();
person.name = �Nicholas�;
person.age = 29;


var person = {}; //same as new Object()



= new Array(�red�, �blue�, �green�);
=new Array();
var aa=new Array(20);//now aa.length value is 20



var value = �25�;
var number = Number(value); //casting function
alert(typeof number); //�number�
var obj = new Number(value); //constructor
alert(typeof obj); //�object�

var values = [1,2,]; //AVOID! Creates an array with 2 or 3 items
var options = [,,,,,]; //AVOID! creates an array with 5 or 6 items
inconsistent implementation
of early versions of Internet Explorer, using this syntax is strongly discouraged

Finding array
--------------------
Array.isArray(aa)//ECMA 5
if(aa instanceof Array)//ECMA 3 and above .. If we use multiple frames this will not work well




var colors = [�red�, �blue�, �green�]; //creates an array with three strings
alert(colors.toString()); //red,blue,green
alert(colors.valueOf()); //red,blue,green
alert(colors); //red,blue,green

StackMethods for array
---------------------------
aa.push("val");adds at top
aa.pop();gets last added

var colors = new Array(); //create an array
var count = colors.push(�red�, �green�); //push two items
alert(count); //2

Stack and queueMethods for array
---------------------------
aa.push("val");adds at top
aa.pop();gets last added
aa.shift(); //get the first item-- it is queue method
colors.unshift(�red�, �green�); //push two items

var values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
values.reverse();
alert(values); //5,4,3,2,1
Even though the values in this example begin in correct numeric order, the sort() method changes
that order based on their string equivalents. bcs., by default sort method call tostring() method while doing sorting
to solve this 
sort() method allows you to pass in a comparison
function that indicates which value should come before which

function compare(value1, value2) {
if (value1 < value2) {
return -1;
} else if (value1 > value2) {
return 1;
} else {
return 0;
}
}

now - 
values.sort(compare);
alert(values); //0,1,5,10,15 `	



every() � Runs the given function on every item in the array and returns true if the
function returns true for every item.
filter() � Runs the given function on every item in the array and returns an array of all
items for which the function returns true.
forEach() � Runs the given function on every item in the array. This method has no
return value.
map() � Runs the given function on every item in the array and returns the result of each
function call in an array.
some() � Runs the given function on every item in the array and returns true if the
function returns true for any one item.






As such,
the Date type stores dates as the number of milliseconds that have passed since midnight on
January 1, 1970 UTC (Universal Time Code).


ISO 8601 extended format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ (such as 2004-05-
25T00:00:00). This works only in ECMAScript 5�compliant implementations

 

var start = Date.now();
//call a function
doSomething();
//get stop time
var stop = Date.now(),
result = stop � start;


Some of the most interesting parts of ECMAScript are its functions, primarily because functions
actually are objects. Each function is an instance of the Function type that has properties and
methods just like any other reference type. Because functions are objects, function names are simply
pointers to function objects and are not necessarily tied to the function itself





var sum = function(num1, num2){
return num1 + num2;
};
Note that there is no name
included after the function keyword, because it�s not needed � the function can be referenced
by the variable sum.

why in ecma script there is no function overloading??
	bcs here function names are pointers. so if we use same name for two different functions
then funcction name will refer  last or latest function object


The last way to defi ne functions is by using the Function constructor, which accepts any number
of arguments. The last argument is always considered to be the function body, and the previous
arguments enumerate the new function�s arguments. Take this for example:
var sum = new Function(�num1�, �num2�, �return num1 + num2�); //not recommended


This syntax is not recommended because it causes a double interpretation of the code (once for the
regular ECMAScript code and once for the strings that are passed into the constructor) and thus
can affect performance

Because function names are simply pointers to functions, they act like any other variable containing
a pointer to an object. This means it�s possible to have multiple names for a single function,

var a = function()
{}
var b = a;
b();// valid





Note: If we use function name without (), then it will refer function pointer
by default functions are objects. function names are pointers





function aa()//Called function declarations
{}

and 

var aa=function()//Function Expressions
{}

above both will work. but wat is difference??
The difference here is based on How JavaScript engine loads data into the execution context.so below code runs perfectly
alert(sum(10,10));
function sum(num1, num2){
return num1 + num2;
}

function declarations are read and added to the execution context
before the code begins running through a process called function declaration hoisting.
As the code
is being evaluated, the JavaScript engine does a fi rst pass for function declarations and pulls them
to the top of the source tree

but function expresiosn will get fail here



Because functions are objectes and function names are pointers, 
	we can able to pass function as a parameter to another function 
	and we can able to return aother function



Two special objects exist inside a function: arguments and this.

function outer(){
inner();
}
function inner(){
alert(arguments.callee.caller);
}
outer();

in strict mode arguments.callee results in an error


Each function has two properties: length and prototype. The length property indicates
the number of named arguments

prototype is the actual location of all instance methods for reference types, meaning methods such
as toString() and valueOf() actually exist on the prototype and are then accessed from the
object instances.


function can return another function

function a(str)

{

return function(anotherparam)

{

return str +anotherparam;
//See str variable able to access by inner function
}
}
pointer1 = a("pointer1");//creates new function object and returns the pointer
pointer2 = a("pointer2");
pointer1("hh")
 //"pointer1hh"

pointer2("hh")
//"pointer2hh";//still str able to gets its value



Two special objects exist inside a function: arguments and this

function factorial(num){
if (num <= 1) {
return 1;
} else {
return num * arguments.callee(num-1);// it is equaent to factorial(num-1).. here arguments.callee is refering the current function. withought using name we can go with this.
// this will be helpful when we are using anonymus funcitons
}
}



this object
-------------
reference to the context object

when a function is called in the global scope of a web page, the this object points
to window



window.color = �red�;
var o = { color: �blue� };
function sayColor(){
alert(this.color);
}
sayColor(); //�red�// imagin we are calling window.sayColor();
o.sayColor = sayColor;
o.sayColor(); //�blue�


Remember that function names are simply variables containing pointers, so the
global sayColor() function and o.sayColor() point to the same function even
though they execute in different contexts.

ECMAScript 5 also formalizes an additional property on a function object: caller.



function having two objects inside
1. this
2. arguments

function having two properties inside
1. prototype
2. length // tells the number of arguments passed to the function

function having two methods
1. apply
2. call


prototype is the actual location of all instance methods for reference types, meaning methods such
as toString() and valueOf() actually exist on the prototype and are then accessed from the
object instances.


function sum(num1, num2){
return num1 + num2;
}
function callSum1(num1, num2){
return sum.apply(this, arguments); //passing in arguments object// here this is used to set the context
}
function callSum2(num1, num2){
return sum.apply(this, [num1, num2]); //passing in array
}
alert(callSum1(10,10)); //20
alert(callSum2(10,10)); //20

In this example, callSum1() executes the sum() method, passing in this as the this value (which
is equal to window because it�s being called in the global scope) and also passing in the arguments
object.

In strict mode, the this value of a function called without a context object is
not coerced to window. Instead, this becomes undefined unless explicitly set by
either attaching the function to an object or using apply() or call().


The call() method exhibits the same behavior as apply(), but arguments are passed to it
differently. The first argument is the this value, but the remaining arguments are passed directly

function sum(num1, num2){
return num1 + num2;
}
function callSum(num1, num2){
return sum.call(this, num1, num2);
}
alert(callSum(10,10)); //20



Difference between call, apply, bind
-----------------------------------------
call - if know the number of paramters properly we can use. 
we can directly pass the parameters like normal funciton call
ex:
function add(a,b){}
add.call(this,2,3);

apply - if we doesnt know the number of parameters. we have to pass array of arguments
add.apply(this,[2,3])

bind - it is not like apply and call. apply and call will make funciton call. but bind will return new function object with specific context bounded within it
addFnWithContext = add.bind(this);
addFnWithContext(2,3);






here this is used to pass the context. we can able to pass any object
window.color = �red�;
var o = { color: �blue� };
function sayColor(){
alert(this.color);
}
sayColor(); //red
sayColor.call(this); //red
sayColor.call(window); //red
sayColor.call(o); //blue


The advantage of using call() (or apply()) to augment the scope is that the object doesn�t need to
know anything about the method.

ECMAScript 5 defi nes an additional method called bind(). The bind() method creates a new
function instance whose this value is bound to the value that was passed into bind(). For example:
window.color = �red�;
var o = { color: �blue� };
function sayColor(){
alert(this.color);
}
var objectSayColor = sayColor.bind(o);
objectSayColor(); //blue

For functions, the inherited methods toLocaleString() and toString() always return the
function�s code. The exact format of this code varies from browser to browser
The
inherited method valueOf() simply returns the function itself






when we read the primitive data types (string, boolean, number), internally respective wrapper reference type's instance will get created, and its methods will be used



Three special reference types are designed to ease interaction with primitive values: the Boolean
type, the Number type, and the String type. These types can act like the other reference types
but they also have a special behavior related to their primitive-type
equivalents. Every time a primitive value is read, an object of the corresponding primitive wrapper
type is created behind the scenes, allowing access to any number of methods for manipulating the
data. Consider the following example:
var s1 = �some text�;
var s2 = s1.substring(2);
In this code, s1 is a variable containing a string, which is a primitive value. On the next line, the
substring() method is called on s1 and stored in s2. Primitive values aren�t objects, so logically
they shouldn�t have methods, though this still works as you would expect. In truth, there is a lot
going on behind the scenes to allow this seamless operation. When s1 is accessed in the second line,
it is being accessed in read mode, which is to say that its value is being read from memory. Any time
a string value is accessed in read mode, the following three steps occur:
1. Create an instance of the String type.
2. Call the specifi ed method on the instance.
3. Destroy the instance.

You can think of these three steps as they�re used in the following three lines of ECMAScript code:
var s1 = new String(�some text�);
var s2 = s1.substring(2);
s1 = null;


This behavior allows the primitive string value to act like an object. These same three steps are
repeated for Boolean and numeric values using the Boolean and Number types, respectively.
The major difference between reference types and primitive wrapper types is the lifetime of the
object. When you instantiate a reference type using the new operator, it stays in memory until it goes
out of scope, whereas automatically created primitive wrapper objects exist for only one line of code
before they are destroyed. This means that properties and methods cannot be added at runtime.

Take this for example:
var s1 = �some text�;
s1.color = �red�;
alert(s1.color); //undefined

It is possible to create the primitive wrapper objects explicitly using the Boolean, Number, and
String constructors

var obj = new Object(�some text�);
alert(obj instanceof String); //true


widow object is a global object. every 


Any function that is called with the new operator acts
as a constructor,


Casting in javascript
----------------------

convert integer to string using String().
const strDisplay = String(score)+" - this is score";


truthy check
-----------------

if(objarray)
if ( !array.length )
if ( string )


closures
------------
closures are functions returns a fucntion. 

var add = function (a) {
    return function (b) {
        return a + b;
    };
};

var addFive = add(5);

alert(addFive(10));//returns  15. note that previously passed 5 is still available for innerfunction;


escape()  used to format a string so it conforms to URL encoding rules



eval
----------
eval() executes your JavaScript in the same context (# it will access current conexted properties and damage those)
as the rest of your application. So we should avoid using this. bcs if any unwanted code injected by third person
it will damage the application

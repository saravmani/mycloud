Microsoft.AspNetCore.All // is  a base package
//it is META PACKAGE. this brings other packages    

If we having this meta package, we no need to install other packages expilicitly.

Add Below middleware in configruation
app.UseMvcWithDefaultRoute();

Add Below MVC framework service in service 
services.AddMvc();

app.UseMvcWithDefaultRoute();//it is having default routing
app.UseMvc(ConfigRoute);// Not having default routing. we have to configure it
private void ConfigRoute(IRouteBuilder routeBuilder)
{
    routeBuilder.MapRoute("Default","{controller}/{action}/{id?}");
    //here id with ? mark is optional parameter
}

in .net core all the middlewares are placed into 
Microsoft.AspnetCore.Builder. Microsoft follows this standard.

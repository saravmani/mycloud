# I tried below example and found that cToken suplied automatically by webapi framework.
 i found this in object explorer in debug mode

public class PageSizeController : ApiController, ICustomController
{
  private static string TargetUrl = "http://apress.com";
  public async Task<long> GetPageSize(CancellationToken cToken)
  {



# there is no where i found that CancellationToken is used in webapi .. may be i have to restart the iis and check this

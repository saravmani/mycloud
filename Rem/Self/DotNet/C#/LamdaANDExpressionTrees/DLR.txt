# my comments - What is dynamic here? which means, until runtime, applicaion doesnt know -about -  type, parameters


The dynamic language runtime (DLR) is a runtime environment that adds a set of services for dynamic
languages to the common language runtime (CLR). The DLR makes it easier to develop dynamic languages
to run on the .NET Framework and to add dynamic features to statically typed languages.

Like the CLR, the DLR is a part of the .NET Framework and is provided with the .NET
Framework and Visual Studio installation packages.
The open-source version of the DLR is also available for download on the IronLanguages/dlr repo on GitHub

Most dynamic languages provide the following advantages for developers:
  Easier refactoring and code modifications, because you do not have to change static type declarations throughout the code.
  Supports REPL, or read-evaluate-print loop)

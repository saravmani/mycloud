Linux COmmands
---------------
ctl+alt+t - to open the terminal

ctl+shift+v - paste into terminal

## linux commands in terminal will not show any success message on terminal.
so if we run any command and it didn return any value on screen then that command was mostly successfull
ex: kill 23445 //this will kill the process and on success it wont display any message

echo some text to print
//this will print the text on screen

tilt ~ symbol shows terminal working in regular user
# symbol shows root user 

PWD - print working directory
    it tesll which directory i am currently located
ls 
    listing of everything in current directory
ls -R 
    this will show all the files in directory and subdirectory
ls -All 
    shwos all informations about the file
ls -R -All
    subdirectory + all info
ls -a see hidden file

Work with text files
---------------------
cat command
-----------
used for display, copy, combine, create
cat > file1  // to create the file
cat file1 // to read the file
cat file1 file2 > nefile // copy file 1 and 2 into new file


CD - used for navigation (## it is like in windows)
    ex: cd Downloads

CD ..  - used to navigate back
cd / - used to navigate to root directory. it is a top of everything
absolute path:
    cd /home/mani/somefolder/another
relative path
    cd somefolder/another
cd~ - navigate to home directory


cp - copy COmmands
   ex: cp txt1 txt2   //this will copy txt1 as txt2
   ex: cp txt1 /home/anotherfolder // this copy the file to another folder
mv - move files 
  sudo mv test /home/guru99/files
  //Move command needs user permission. it can be root pwd or user's pwd
mv test test1 // to rename the files

rm - remove the file
    ex: rm txt2

 mkdir - create new folder
    ex: mkdir test
rmdir  -  to remove the folder (if folder is empty)

rm -r folderName - used to delete folder which is having documents inside

man - maual COmmands
    this command used to get the more details of the command


sudo fdisk - gives disk info
ifconfig - gives ip address related informations
## it s like ipconfig in windows

touch - used to create files
ex: touch testfile.txt

locate - used to search files
ex: locate -i  *red*house**city*

create new user
-------------------------
sudo usermod -a -g home anotherName


directory structure
home/username


history   //this command display history of commands used in current terminal



redirectin the output
-----------------------
> // used for output redirection. stdout
< // used for input stdin
ex:
ls > filename.txt
// this will store output of ls into filename.txt 
cat filename.txt 
// this read content from the file and write into screen

echo rewrw rewre > txterwr.txt

instead of rewriting in the file and if we want to append the
 text then use 
>>  symbol
ex: echo ssss another text >> txterwr.txt

find 
-----------
used to search the file with specific name.
ex:
find . -name 'nm*'
//this will list down files wich starts with nm text.
// also this command will display errors like permission denied

but we can able to redirect error alone into seperate file.
for that we can use below command
ex:
find . -name 'nm*' 2> errorlog.txt

// here 2 indicates error descripter
//i.e if any program runs, below 3 files will be opened
input,output and error


Use pipes to run two commands consecutively.

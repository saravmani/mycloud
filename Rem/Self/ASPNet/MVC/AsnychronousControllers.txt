The AsyncController class enables you to write asynchronous action methods. 
You can use asynchronous action methods for long-running, non-CPU bound requests. 
This avoids blocking the Web server from performing work while the request is being processed.
 A typical use for the AsyncController class is long-running Web service calls.

GIT
-----------
#Start
Git written in C. so it is faster.
Though Git mirrors entire repository, the size of the data on the client side is small, because git compress the data and store.

GIT is DVCS (distributed version control). so every client will have its won copy. and changes will update in server.

as most of the operations are happening in local, operations are very easy
 developers don't interact with the server unless they need to push or pull changes.

git is more secured.
Git uses a common cryptographic hash function called secure hash function (SHA1),

Working directory -> Staging Area -> Git repository



in project we ill have .git folder. this will have config, tracking files. ALl the changes is getting maintained in this directory.
if we delete this then git cannot track the changes


staged or cached both commands are same

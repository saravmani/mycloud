REDIS
--------
Redis is a data store well suited to handling simple data that doesn’t need to be
stored for long-term access, such as instant messages and game-related data. Redis
stores data in RAM, logging changes to it to disk. The downside to this is that storage
space is limited, but the advantage is that Redis can perform data manipulation
quickly. If a Redis server crashes and the contents of RAM are lost, the disk log can be
used to restore the data


supported datastructures
--------------------------------
Most of the data structures supported
by Redis will be familiar to developers, as they’re analogous to those frequently
used in programming: hash tables, lists, and key/value pairs (which are used like simple
variables). Hash table and key/value pair

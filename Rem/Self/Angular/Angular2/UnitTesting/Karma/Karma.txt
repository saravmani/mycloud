Karma is a test runner, which means it monitors the files in a project and runs the tests that have been
defined using Jasmine when it detects a change. Together, these tools make it easy to define and run unit
tests in JavaScript projects.

The most difficult part of setting up unit testing is getting the correct configuration,
 which can require some
trial and error. The problem is that testing Angular applications requires using the
 JavaScript module loader
to handle the dependencies in the application so that the unit test can access Angular functionality, 
which in
turn requires the JavaScript packages that Angular relies on. 
The first step is to create a Karma configuration
file, which I did by adding a file called karma.conf.js

    # it is simple. i done that in good sheet. it works fine



IT is a  special area of STASTICS called BIVARIATE
  BIVARIATE-means 2 variables


The main idea is draw a straight line through a data points to reduce the sum of squares of the residuals

# Dependent variable - is a output required using multiple or single Independent variables

y = mx+ b
b = y interceptor (the place where x meets y. at this point x value is 0)
m = raising slope vlaue
x = indipendent variables which is given
y = Dependant variable

Example simple linear regression formula
E(Y) = B0 + B1X

E(Y) = Expected value of Y
B0 = y intercept
B1 = slope

Actually Y is not actual y. it is a best possible value. it is a  mean of y values at given x value

ErrorCode<ERRCA0017>:SubStatus<ES0006>

 Before intializing the DataCacheFactory modify the DataCacheFactoryConfiguration.ChannelOpenTimeout 
of the dataCacheFactoryConfiguration
 instance that you are using to a larger value of 2 minutes.
 (can’t use configuration to set the value, since 20 seconds in the allowed limit) .
 Also, this recommendation is only for debugging purposes and ideally should not be needed in production environments.



After uninstalling we not able to re install appfabric. because previous installation had done some changes
in machine.config file. we have to remove it manually before try to deploy the new.

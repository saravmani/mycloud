in windows docker can able to run windows container and linux containers.
so using this we can able to run windows softwares and linux softwares on windows :-)

DOcker installation
------------------------
to install docker on windows 10 it needs hyper-v enabled.
but windows 10 home edition not having hyper-v option.
so we need to update windows home edition to windows 10 professional


Docker is open
container
docker
----------

isolated environment. application will have all the items within this container


visual studio tools docker -> this tool we can install on vsts , so that using vsts 2015 we can
install our app in docker


 Vagrant -- ## dont know what is vagrant


 we can create docker image and it will build the environment

 docker image has complete environment to run the application

 ex: if it is a node js application then docker image has
 application
 nodejs

 if we deboy this image in any machine, that machine no need to
 have node js into it. bcs docuker image has this node js


Docker can able to share the base libraries.
# i got this from utube. but have to validate this..
ex: if we want to run node js application on 3 containers.. then all those containers
no need to have node js copy. one container can share this

docker image files are actually very small

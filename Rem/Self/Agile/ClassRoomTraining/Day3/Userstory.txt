INVEST Principle in user story

Good User should  not have dependency

“I” ndependent (of all others)
“N” egotiable (not a specific contract for features)
“V” aluable (or vertical)
“E” stimable (to a good approximation)
“S” mall (so as to fit within an iteration)
“T” estable (in principle, even if there isn’t a test for it yet)



if user story is big then have cut it VERTICALLY as much as possible.

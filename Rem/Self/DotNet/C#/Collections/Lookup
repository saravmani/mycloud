Uses
----------
imagine you're creating a data structure to hold the contents of a phone book. 
You want to key by lastName and then by firstName. 
Using a dictionary here would be dangerous because many people 
can have the same name. So a Dictionary will always, at most, map to a single value.

A Lookup will map to potentially several values.

Lookup["Smith"]["John"] will be a collection of size one billion.

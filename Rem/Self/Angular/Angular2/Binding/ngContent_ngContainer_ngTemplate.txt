ng-container vs template
------------------------
Both of them are at the moment (2.x, 4.x) used to group elements together without
having to introduce another element which will be rendered on the page (such as div or span).

template, however, requires nasty syntax. For example,

<li *ngFor="let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn">...</li>
would become

<template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items" let-i="index" [ngForTrackBy]="trackByFn">
  <li>...</li>
</template>
You can use ng-container instead since it follow the nice * syntax
 which you expect and are probably already familiar with.

<ng-container *ngFor="let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn">
  <li>...</li>
</ng-container>


ng-content
----------
used for container. it will not generate any aditional tag
<ng-container></ng-content> this used to get the data from parent contontrol like below
parent-component.ts
<child-component>some content needs to go inside of ng-content tag </child-component>

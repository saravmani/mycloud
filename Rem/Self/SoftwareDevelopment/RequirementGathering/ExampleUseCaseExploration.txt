Early requirement document
 this contains high level features
from this we have to extract use cases

use this document - we can get idea of what is this project

example, in below requirement line we can extract usecases
User can login to their account and upload fav music files.

from above high level requirement we extract below use cases. Those use cases are not 
in detail. It should be simple and understandable
User register
Edit User info
Login
Logout
Change password, forget password
Upload option for sound file . Mp3, etc.,
add the lable name for song
view uploaded list for files
delete those files
play the song

based on this use cases, BA or Client can add the missing part.

Then find the dependencies

ex: Change password needed Login and login needed User register

so the use case order should start from User register

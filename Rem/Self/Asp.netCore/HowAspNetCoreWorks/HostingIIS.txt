---------------------------
To host asp.net core application in IIS we need ".NET Core Hosting bundle"
The .NET Core Hosting bundle is an installer for the .NET Core Runtime and the ASP.NET Core Module. The bundle allows ASP.NET Core apps to run with IIS.
.NET Core Hosting bundle = .NET Core Runtime + ASP.NET Core Module

ASP.NET Core Module - sits with iis pipeline and allowing ASP.NET Core applications to work with IIS. ASP.NET Core Module is forward and backward compatible with LTS releases of .NET.
Asp.net core module can run Asp.net core app by
    Hosting an ASP.NET Core app inside of the IIS worker process (w3wp.exe), called the in-process hosting model.
    Forwarding web requests to a backend ASP.NET Core app running the Kestrel server, called the out-of-process hosting model.



-----------------------------------------------------------OLD stdy

asp.ent core is seperate console applicaiton

IIS will communciate with asp.netcore console app through some port
For this IIS needs some HttpModules


before year 2003 ASP.NET 1.x and IIS was worked in this same model.
Asp.At that time, ASP.NET had its own worker process communicating with IIS through named pipes.
Later, the tasks of the ASP.NET worker process have been absorbed by the built-in IIS worker
process (w3wp.exe), creating the concept of application pools.


ASP.NET Core IIS Module (ANCM),
------------------------------------
ANCM must be installed in IIS on the server (or IIS Express on your
development machine) for the IIS integration to work. Visual Studio automatically
installs ANCM for us on IIS Express. ANCM for servers can be downloaded from

## note here IISExpress also needs this module. so in development environment, when we run applicaiton
in IISExpress, then it is doing reverse proxy and passing the request to kestrol :-)

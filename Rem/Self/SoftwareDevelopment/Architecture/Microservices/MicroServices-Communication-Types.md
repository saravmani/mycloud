#### Microservices - Communication Types
######
1. REquest driven architecture  - Mostly REST, gRPC
   (Request and Response based). Clear control
2. Event Driven architecture - Services will not ineract directly. One service will publish an event and another service will subscribe for the event and perform the operation.  Services will be decoupled from each other
3. Hybrid architecture - As name suggests it uses both the types depends on the scenario

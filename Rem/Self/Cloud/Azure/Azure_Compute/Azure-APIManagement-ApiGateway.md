#### Product
- When we publish the api  using API Management then it wil packaged as a PRODUCT. Product contain 1 or more API and description.
- It can be open or protected

#### Policy
- It is simple XML documents
- In Azure API Management, a policy is a collection of statements that are executed sequentially on the request or response of an API1.
- Policies allow API publishers to change the behavior of APIs through configuration
- Ex: Convert from XML to JSON, Rate Limiting, IP address filtering


> *** The policy XML configuration is divided into inbound, backend, outbound, and on-error sections. This series of specified policy statements is executed in order for a request and a response. If an error occurs during the processing of a request, any remaining steps in the inbound, backend, or outbound sections are skipped. Execution jumps to the statements in the on-error section****


#### Sample Policy
```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <base />
        <set-header name="X-Content-Type-Options" exists-action="override">
            <value>nonsniff</value>
        </set-header>
    </inbound>
    <backend>
        <base />
    </backend>
    <outbound>
        <base />
    </outbound>
    <on-error>

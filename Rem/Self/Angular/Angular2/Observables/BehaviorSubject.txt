it is a type of Subject which always emits the last emitted value to any new subscriber. 

#Normal Subject only emits the future events. but what about newly subscribed user? 
he ownt get those old data

But BehaviorSubject needs an initial value. 

Since our data source is a back-end service, there is no synchronous value to initialize with.
Hence, we live with using an undefined as the initial state.

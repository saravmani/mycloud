Strict Class Initialization
-----------------------------------
TypeScript 2.7 introduces a new flag called --strictPropertyInitialization. 
This flag performs checks to ensure that each instance property of a class gets initialized 
in the constructor body, or by a property initializer

class C {
    foo: number;
    bar = "hello";
    baz: boolean;
//  ~~~
//  Error! Property 'baz' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the
//         constructor.

    constructor() {
        this.foo = 42;
    }
}

In the above, if we truly meant for baz to potentially be undefined, we should have declared it with the type boolean | undefined.

Administrator level
---------------------
Use least privileged account for applications. this accounts should not have drop/create options, also should not have option to change
access rights. by this way we can minimise the impact
as much as possible we have to give permissions which is really needed for the application to run

Use stored proc
Use ORM (like entity framework)
Try to avoid dynamic queries
Try to parameterise the query
we can validate all the inputs before sending to the query(like removing single quotes )

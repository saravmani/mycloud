Routing system supports a special path, denoted by two asterisks (the ** characters), that allows
routes to match any URL.

{ path: "**", component: NotFoundComponent }


Redirections in Routes
---------------------------
Routes can also be used as aliases that redirect the browser to a
different URL.
{ path: "does", redirectTo: "/form/create", pathMatch: "prefix" },
{ path: "table", component: TableComponent },
{ path: "", redirectTo: "/table", pathMatch: "full" },

prefix  - it matches URLs that start with the specified path,
ignoring any subsequent segments.
full  -  it matches only the URL specified by the path property.

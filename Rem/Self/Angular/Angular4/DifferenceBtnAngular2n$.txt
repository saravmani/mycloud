angualr 4 changes

Angular Universal is available as part for angular

	in angular 2 there is no else statement. now angular 4 it is possible
<div *ngIf="condition;else elsePart">some txt</div>
<ng-template #elsePart>
<div>some code</div>
</ng-template>


Renderer2 (new renderer)
-----------------------------
Renderer2 has released. but still Renderer also will work. 
import {Component,Renderer2} from'@angular/core'
Renderer depriciated. it may removed in future.


Email validator
--------------------
angular 2 to do email validation we have to use regex
angular 2
	<input type="email" pattern="[1-9A-Z]" />

now in angular 4 we are having email directive. we can simply use this
	<input type="email" email />


now we can able to use typescript2. but previously typescript 1.8 was supported

New animation module has released. Previously those was there in core module itself.
but now different module.
Ex of animation components - animate,state,style,transition,trigger

GOF - under this 24 patterns are There	
P of EAA - patterns of enterprise application Architecure


while implementing design patterns you often use one or more of the
SOLID principles (such as SRP or OCP). Thus, SOLID principles and design patterns go hand in hand.

designment will play key role in 
	developing (for developer community)
	development of stable,robust application

HLD document
	should contains high level Architecure diagram with componets
	and ech componet functionality at highlevel
	how the components are interacting
	if we are using any sub system how it is interacting
	also have to specify design decisions
		ex: why mvc, why angular 2


What is a software problem? A software problem is basically a task that
you wish to accomplish. For example, creating an object and filling it with data from a database 
is a software problem. There are countless such problems that you will come across. 
Many times these problems are recurring, and so are their solutions.


Simply put, a design pattern is a time-proven solution for a
known design problem.


why we are splitting Presentation,BC,DAL?
---------------------------------------------------
Mainly enterprise applications deals with - data management, business rules, and user interface. 
That’s why modern applications divide the
whole application into three conceptual layers:
• Data-access layer
• Business-logic layer
• User-interface or presentation layer
An


those three layers must be noted that this division is said to be conceptual because 
all three pieces can reside on a
single server. For larger systems these layers might be deployed onto different physical servers,
resulting in a distributed system. In the latter case they are called tiers

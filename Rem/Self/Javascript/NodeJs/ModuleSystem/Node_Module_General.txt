three major components to this module system: requiring built-in modules,
requiring third-party modules, and making your own modules.\

How variables are magically scopped to file?
  In node js each file is a module. And before compiling  a module node wraps the module
  code in a funciton.
  we can see this using below code
  require("module").wrapper
  this wrapper having 5 arguments exports, require,module, filename, directoryname 
because of this wrapping, any variables within the file(module), will scopped to that particular
module.

Why export object can't be replaced directly?
exports.id=1; //works
exports={id:1};//not works
module.exports={id:1};//works

exports is a local reference to module.exports. like var exports = module.exports.
so if we modify the exports reference, this it will not refer module.exports. 
so exports = {} will not work

var g =22;// it is local to the file 

wrapp functions return value is exports object.

exports is equal to module.exports

Libraries that target .NET Standard will run on any .NET Standard compliant runtime, such as .NET Core,
.NET Framework, Mono/Xamarin.
On the other hand, libraries that target .NET Core can only run on the .NET Core runtime



.NET Standard 2.0 is implemented by the latest versions of .NET Framework, .NET Core,
and Xamarin. .NET Standard 2.0 makes it much easier for developers to share code between
any flavor of .NET.

For .NET Core 2.0, this adds many of the missing APIs that developers need to port old
code written for .NET Framework to the cross-platform .NET Core. However, some APIs
are implemented, but throw an exception to indicate to a developer that they should not
actually be used! This is usually due to differences in the operating system on which you
run .NET Core.

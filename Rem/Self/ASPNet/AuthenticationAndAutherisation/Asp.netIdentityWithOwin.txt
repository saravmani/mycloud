ASP.Net Identity on top of OWIN

The "Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Owin" package provides many useful 
extensions and we will use this while working with ASP.Net Identity on top of OWIN. 
It also downloads some other dependency packages. One of those dependency packages is 
"Microsoft.Owin.Security.OAuth". This is a core package required to 
support any standard OAuth 2.0 authentication workflow. 
The “Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb” namespace contains the types 
related to handling OWIN requests. 
It helps us to run OWIN-based applications on IIS using the ASP.NET request pipeline.

PM> Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Owin
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb

ASP.NET Identity also supports the Entity Framework. 
Here we will use ASP.Net identity with Entity Framework, so we need to install this via Nuget packages.

PM> Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework

"!local repository" && "! remote repository"
-----------------------------------------------

CMD:git remote //give list of remote connecitons
CMD:git remote add remoteName https://github... 
//used to add remotes

To remove remote repository
CMD:git remote rm remoteName

this informations are stored in 
.git/config file

we can able to add multiple remote repositories like this

push files into server
------------------------
CMD: git push -u test_remote master
//here we are pushing files into master !branch
when first time run this command this will ask username and pwd
we have to give our github credentials

This will compress the files and push to remote server

 once done this our "!local repository" knows aboute "! remote repository"

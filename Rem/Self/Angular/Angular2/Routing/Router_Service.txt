The Types of Event Provided by the Router.events Observer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NavigationStart This event is sent when the navigation process starts.
RoutesRecognized This event is sent when the routing system matches the URL to a route.
NavigationEnd This event is sent when the navigation process completes successfully.
NavigationError This event is sent when the navigation process produces an error.
NavigationCancel This event is sent when the navigation process is canceled.


All the event classes define an id property, which returns a number that is incremented each for each
navigation, and a url property that returns the target URL.

The RoutesRecognized and NavigationEnd
events also define a urlAfterRedirects property that returns the URL that has been navigated to.


router.events
.filter(e => e instanceof NavigationEnd || e instanceof NavigationCancel)
.subscribe(e => { this.lastMessage = null; });

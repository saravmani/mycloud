 -------------------------------
Data sources that make network requests can be hard to isolate for unit testing because it is hard to
differentiate between the behavior of the data source class and any unexpected effects caused by the
network and the server.
There is an NPM package available that provides an in-memory API service that can be used to simulate
HTTP requests using data that has been defined locally. This provides a way to isolate a data source
class and ensure that only its behavior is being tested. The package is called angular-in-memory-webapi,

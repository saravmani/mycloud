#Start 
Git written in C. so it is faster.
Though Git mirrors entire repository, the size of the data on the client side is small, bcause git compress the data and store.

GIT is DVCS (distributed version controll). so every client will have its won copy. and changes will update in server.

as moste of the operations are happening in local, operations are very easy
 developers don’t interact with the server unless they need to push or pull changes. 

git is more secured.
Git uses a common cryptographic hash function called secure hash function (SHA1),



Working directory -> Staging Area -> Git repository

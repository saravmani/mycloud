Another .NET initiative is .NET Native. This compiles C# code to native CPU instructions
ahead-of-time (AoT), rather than using the CLR to compile intermediate language (IL)
code just-in-time (JIT) to native code later.
.NET Native improves execution speed and reduces the memory footprint for applications.
It supports the following:
UWP apps for Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox One, HoloLens, and
Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as Raspberry Pi
Server-side web development with ASP.NET Core
Console applications for use on the command line

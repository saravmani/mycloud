 The Visual Studio Emulator for Android is only available in Visual Studio 2015

Appachi cordova
it is opensource - own by appachi software foundation
Phone gap is distirbution of appachi cordova by adobe

cordova version 4 has got released mid of 2015

Using visual studio we can do profiling for cordova applications

in visual studio we are having 3 types of debugging
1. rippele - browser based
2. emulators/simulators android,ios and windows
3. physical devvices



while writing code there are mainly two events.
 1. device ready - when all the items are ready - dom+images+content etcc.,
 2. dom ready - when dom is ready - this is the first thing will get ready actually

Ex:
document.addEventListener( 'deviceready', onDeviceReady.bind( this ), false );
    function onDeviceReady() {


Cordova developed by phone gap team



Cordova security policy doesn't allow inline events so we will add event listeners 
We should always add event listeners in our js instead of inline event calling since Cordova "Content Security Policy" doesn't allow inline Javascript.
If we try to call event inline, we will get the following error.
we have to keep in mind this when we create application for desktop and mobile. bcs in desktop inline events will work but not in mobile app.




Cordova plugman is useful command line tool for installing and managing plugins. You should use plugman if you want your app to run on one specific platform. If you want to create cross-platform app you should use cordova-cli which will modify plugins for different platforms.


npm install -g plugman
C:\Users\username\Desktop\CordovaProject>plugman 
   install --platform android --project platforms\android 
   --plugin cordova-plugin-camera
   plugman uninstall --platform android --project platforms\android 
   --plugin cordova-plugin-camera

Impersonation (Use specific user account to access all the resources)
------------------
<identity impersonate="true" userName="AccountNAME" password="Password" />
Impersonation is a technique to access application resources using the identity of some other user..
By default, Impersonation is off.
 By default, all ASP.NET code is executed using a fixed machine-specific account.

Output caching 
----------------
The output cache mechanism is implemented via a predefined HTTP module that kicks in for each request that hits the application. 
The module fires after request authorization thus ensuring that you still go through authentication/authorization even for cached requests.
 Frankly, output caching may not be a decisive factor to speed up your site, but I don’t see reasons for not using it on any site where 
clogging could be causing real problems.



IIS Express
----------------

@injectable({providedIn:'root'}) //if we specify like this we no need to mintion in module file for provid property

The sole purpose of the service is to share data between child’s components and to provide a couple of helper’s methods.

If we provide services at module level then it will be singleton for whole applicaiton.
and memory wont get released thorugh the application life

if dont inject all the services at global module. Inject where ever it is reauried



Inject service at component level
  The benefit is that when Angular destroyed the component, Angular will also destroy the service and release the memory


Service also can implement onDestroy Hook

export class AdminService implements OnDestroy {
  ngOnDestroy() {
    // Clean subscriptions, intervals, etc
  }
}


Also if we call NgModuleRef.destroy() or PlatformRef.destroy()
 then ngOnDestroy method of singleton providers will be also executed

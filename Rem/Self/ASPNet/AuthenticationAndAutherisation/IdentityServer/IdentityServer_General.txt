It is officially certified by the openid foundation. And it is completely open source

Identity Server provides 
Extensible openid connect and oauth 2.0 security token service and autherization server

Now a days we no need to have Authentication related stuffs (login, change pwd etc.,) in to our
main applicaion. we can just seperate it(Identity provider)
It's the responsibility of an identity provider (IDP) to authenticate the user and if needed safely
provide proof of identity to an application

In Oauth 2 we will define endpoints from the OAuth2 standard

Oauth 2's Access_Token should'nt be used to sign in to client application. bcs it s 
only autherization token to access the resources of another applicaiton.

Identity server 4 is providing in memory certificate. but previous versions we have to configure 
certificate by own.

Once ur configure identity, it will provide discovery URL. in that it will have all other URLs

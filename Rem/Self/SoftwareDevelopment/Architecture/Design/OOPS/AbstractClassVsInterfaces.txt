Abstract Class Animal
{}

Class Tiger:Animal{} // IS-A Relation ship// Tiger IS-A Animal

Interfaces are contracts. Which is for CAN relation.
Example, what perticular can perform some thing. 
Example - 

interface ISwimmable{doSwim()}

Class Tiger:Animal,ISwimmable{}// Here Tiger CAN do Swim


So when we use Abstract class it should be IS-A relation. and For Interface it should be CAN Relation
Interfaces are contracts. 
So in above Example Tiger CAN do what ISwimmable contract requires to do

When we use ng controller to create a new controller, we created a new scope from within the current scope.
This was done behind the scenes by using the door scope (mumbles) new method. We can also reach the parent scope by using the door scope,
door parent attribute to access the parent scope

Scope inheritance is achieved by prototype inheritance.

if we access a property in $scope object, first it will check the value in current $scope, and if it not found then
it will goes to parent $scope object

if we try to set the same variable name which is there in parent scope , then new variable created in current scope.

to avoid this normally we wont directly create the variables in $scope object instead check below code

angular.module('module1').controller('controllername',function($scope,$http){
var ctobject = this;
$scope.moduleObject = ctobject;
ctobject.propertyOne = "some namess";
});

<div ng-controller="controllername as moduleObject">
{{moduleObject.propertyOne}}
</div>

Note here we are using "controller as syntax"


Another use of "Controller as syntax"
-----------------------------------------------
Directives also some times creates new Scope. So the same scenario occurs if we use directives
ex:
ng-if
ng-repeat

Pessimistic concurrency deals with acquiring database locks on the data that is being
used by a user. Whenever a user reads a row from the database, a read-only lock is
acquired on this record. Other users can also request a read-only lock during this
period. If a user requests an update, an update lock is acquired on the row and until
this lock is released, no other users are allowed to read or update the data of this row.

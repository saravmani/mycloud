projections

LINQ projections essentially mean that instead of returning a complete
entity we want to return either a subset of properties from that entity in the form
of an object or perhaps, we want to return an object that contains properties from
multiple entities.
Projections are particularly useful when we are dealing with ViewModel in our
application. We can return a ViewModel type object directly from the LINQ query.
Let's take a scenario where we want to retrieve a list of all the employers where the
result should contain the EmployerName value and a list of all the employees that
are associated with this employer. Let's see how we can do this using projections
in LINQ to Entities:
using (SampleDatabaseEntities db = new SampleDatabaseEntities())
{
var employers = from employer in db.Employers
select new
{
EmployerName = employer.EmployerName,
EmployeeList = employer.Employees
};
}


Using projections with LINQ to Entities is very useful
because it enables us to return complex types that contain data from multiple entities

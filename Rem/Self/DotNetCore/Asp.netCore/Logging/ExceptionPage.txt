To display Exception details, special developer exception pages provided by ASP.NET Core.
They are HTML-based pages generated by the runtime that encapsulate all the useful information
around the problem, like the stack trace,

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
}


HTML Page (Exception page) will display full stack trace that
includes a view pointing to the specific line of code in question, the query string
collection, any cookies, and the full request headers that were passed.

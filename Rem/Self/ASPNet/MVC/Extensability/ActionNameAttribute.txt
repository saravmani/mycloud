ActionName attribute
----------------------------
we can change the action method name by
[ActionName("Enumerate")]
public ViewResult List()
{
    return View("Result", new Result
    {
        ControllerName = "Customer",
        ActionName = "List"
    });
}
Applying the attribute overrides the name of the action.

Advantages of ActionName attribute
---------------------------------------
    You can then accept an action name that wouldnâ€™t be legal as a C# method name (for example,
[ActionName("User-Registration")]).
     If you want to have two different C# methods that accept the same set of parameters and
should handle the same action name, but in response to different HTTP request types (for
example, one with [HttpGet] and the other with [HttpPost]), you can give the methods
different C# names to satisfy the compiler, but then use [ActionName] to map them both to the
same action name.

TreaShakkableProviders (From Angular 6)

Refer : TreaShakkableProviders.txt
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'//this is new.
})
 By default, this syntax registers it to the root injector which will make our service an
 application wide singleton.

If this service  not used anywhere then it will not be there in output

Angular version 6 introduced a new feature, Tree Shakeable Providers.

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'//this is new.
})
export class SharedService {
  constructor() {}
}



providedIn - With this property we are telling Angular that - which module to register our service
to instead of having to import the
 module and register it to the providers of a NgModule.
 # We no need to mention in NgModule with provider statement.  for normal service we have to do This

 By default, this syntax registers it to the root injector which will make our service an
 application wide singleton.


If this service  not used anywhere then it will not be there in output

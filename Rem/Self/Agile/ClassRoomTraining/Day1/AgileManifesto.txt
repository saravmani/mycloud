We value
  1) Individual and interactions Over Process n tools
        Ex: A tester instead of logging defect at EOD and developer will take
        It next day and they reject it.
        It is waste of time.
        Instead a tester sit next dev and explain and dev can fix immediately if he as time
  2) Working software over Comprehensive documentation
        Agile says keep minimal doc. if we create a doc it should add REAL value
  3) Customer Collaboration Over Contract negotiation
  4) Responding to change over following plan

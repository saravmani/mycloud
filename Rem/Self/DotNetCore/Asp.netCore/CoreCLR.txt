The .NET Core Framework comes with a new runtime for application execution called CoreCLR


The CoreCLR follows the same layout and architecture of the current .NET CLR and
does things like loading the IL code, compiling to machine-level code, and collecting garbage.

Difference between CLR to CoreCLR
-------------------------------------
The CoreCLR doesnâ€™t support some features of the current CLR,
such as application domains and code access security, that proved unnecessary
or too specific for the Windows platform

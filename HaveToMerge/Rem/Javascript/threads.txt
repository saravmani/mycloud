AppDomain
----------------
The .NET Framework further subdivides an operating system process into lightweight managed subprocesses, called application domains

#
OS
	Process - seperates each application. each application one processes
		Appdomain - which subprocess proveded by .net framework (light weight managed subprocesses)
			Managed Threads (managed threads can be able to move freely across multiple Appdomains)



Thread Pool
------------
ThreadPool class is the easiest way to handle multiple threads for relatively short tasks 


But if we create our own thread, having following advantages. # but creating own threads end with more code complex

1. we can set thread priority
2. set identity for threads





What is cross thread marshelling?

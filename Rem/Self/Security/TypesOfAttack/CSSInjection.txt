CSS injection vulnerabilities arise when an application imports a style sheet from a user-supplied URL, or embeds user input in CSS blocks without adequate escaping. They are closely related to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities but often trickier to exploit.
Being able to inject arbitrary CSS into the victim's browser may enable various attacks, including:
Executing arbitrary JavaScript using IE's expression() function.
Using CSS selectors to read parts of the HTML source, which may include sensitive data such as anti-CSRF tokens.
Capturing any sensitive data within the URL query string by making a further style sheet import to a URL on the attacker's domain, and monitoring the incoming Referer header.

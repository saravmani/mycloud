Linting
--------------------
Finds potential errors and deviation from accepted coding style
TSLint for Type script Linting
TSLint pluggin available for visual studio code.

# i have tried this.. it showing error in the code line itself. and when hover it it shows idea symbol.
using this i can able to fix the specific lint rule error

#i thinkg angular cli provides wrapper and gives new command calld "ng lint"

but for normal projects we can use tslint file.ts

similarly there JSLint, ESLint for javascirpts

TSLint config file contains set of default rules. 
rules can be single line with bool value, or with configurations with first value as bool.
here this bool indicats wether the rules is enabled or disabled.
ex:
"import-spacing": true,//single line rule
 "quotemark": [ //rule with configuraiton array
      true,  //rule is enabled
      "single"
    ],

Default rules mostly give more errors.
normally i will change the below default rules
//disable quotemark rule. so that i can use ' or "
"quotemark": [  
      false,  //rule is disabled
      "single"
    ],

Normally i will try to avoid space related issues

#some rule is thr to avoid var instead we have to use let or const.
var is depricated

what is convention-over-configuration pattern?
i have seen this in .net mvc... here every conroller should be created with suffix of "Controller" word. 
DefaultControllerFactory class follows the convention-over-configuration pattern. You do not

All you need to do is
create classes that meet the criteria that the factory is seeking.

TO know that Budjet is roughly estimated or and time limit also real or not

Just ask owner that
  What if i provide some extra nice feature, but it may take some extra time?
  If client or owner says yes.. then we can assume that they are having little more money


If butdget is 20K means cost may roughly estimated
But if Bueget is 21k means it may be properly estimated

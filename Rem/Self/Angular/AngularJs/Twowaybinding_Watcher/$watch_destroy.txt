 Watchers should be destroyed when they are no longer needed.
 The watchers are costly. They make the digest look slower, which makes the whole app slower.

 Notice, that when we use the $watch function,
 we use it on a certain scope. So whenever the scope is destroyed, all the watchers on that scope are also destroyed.


NOTE:  if you write code that removes some element from the dump directly using native JavaScript or jQuery, the scope will not be destroyed.

Manually destroy the watch
-----------------------------------
var watchdestroyer = $scope.watch("propertyname",function(){
//check some condition
//and call destroyer
watchdestroyer();
});

$scope.watch method will return watch destroyer

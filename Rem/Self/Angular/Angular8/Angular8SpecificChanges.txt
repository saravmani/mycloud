When working with Angular 8, please note that you need to change @ViewChild(...)
to @ViewChild(..., { static: false }).

This should be a temporary change which will not be required anymore once Angular 9
is released (and it's also not required if you're using Angular 7 or
older - check your package.json file to find out which version you're using).

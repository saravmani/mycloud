If you specify the styles as part of the component then
the styles get prefixed with component specific selector
and will be inlined into the generated code. This is done intentionally
to allow you to have style isolation as well as 
ability to code split your style-sheets along with your code for more optimal lazy-loading.


Actually the styles are packaged and delivered to the client by webpack.
Angular-CLI uses webpack under the hood and only configures it.
Angular-CLI loads these styles as a separate bundle to the client.

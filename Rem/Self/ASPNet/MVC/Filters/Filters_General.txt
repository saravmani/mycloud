Filters inject extra logic into MVC Framework request processing.
They provide a simple and elegant way to implement  cross-cutting concerns.


we can implement the filters with the help of IMvcFilter interface.
But the easiest way to create a filter is to derive your class from FilterAttribute, which implements the required interface
and provides some useful basic features, such as handling the default order in which filters are processed


MVC provides ActionFilterAttribute which includes both IActionFilter, IResultFilter.
only benefit of ActionFilterAttribute is that you do not need to override and implement the methods that you do
not intend to use. Otherwise, there is no advantage over implementing the filter interfaces directly.

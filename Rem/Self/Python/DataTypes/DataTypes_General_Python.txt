Built in data types - numbers, strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, and sets

Data values in Python are known as objects;
each object has a type
An object’s type determines which operations the object supports

The type also determines the object’s attributes and
items (if any) and whether the object can be altered

An object that can be altered is
known as a mutable object, while one that cannot be altered is an immutable object

type(obj) - returns the type object that is the type of obj
isinstance(obj, type) - True when object obj has type type

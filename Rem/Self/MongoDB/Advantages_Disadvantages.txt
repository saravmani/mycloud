Large data storage
------------------------
We can store a large data by distributing it to several servers connected to the application.
If a server cannot handle such a
big data then there will be no failure condition. The term we can use here is “auto-sharding”.


High speed -
MongoDB is a document-oriented database. It is easy to access documents by indexing. Hence, it provides fast query response.
The speed of MongoDB is 100 times faster than the relational database.

 Mongo's very friendly when it comes to adding data since it doesn't require a schema, no setup work is needed in order to start working with data.
 (i.e in rdbms we need to create tables - columns - data tyeps.. etc., b4 working)


Disadvantages
=========================
Joins not Supported
MongoDB doesn’t support joins like a relational database. Yet one can use joins functionality by adding by coding it manually. But it may slow execution and affect performance.

b. High Memory Usage
MongoDB stores key names for each value pairs. Also, due to no functionality of joins, there is data redundancy. This results in increasing unnecessary usage of memory.

c. Limited Data Size
You can have document size, not more than 16MB.

d. Limited Nesting
You cannot perform nesting of documents for more than 100 levels.

No transactions except at the record level. If you want a transaction you have to fit the whole transaction into a single record.

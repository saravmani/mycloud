SQL server enterprise edition having this partition feature

Data in a partitioned table is partitioned based on a single column, the partition column, often called the partition key.
 Only one column can be used as the partition column, but it is possible to use a computed column.

n alternative to partitioned tables (for those who donâ€™t have Enterprise Edition) is to create separate tables for each group of rows, union the tables in a view and then query the view instead of the tables.
This is called a partitioned view.

It is important to select a partition column that is almost always used as a filter in queries.
When the partition column is used as a filter in queries, SQL Server can access only the relevant partitions. 
This is called partition elimination and can greatly improve performance when querying large tables.

1. Use AsNoTraking if we are going to read only the data
2. Concurrency - use ROWVERSION or TIMESTAMP. dont use concurr mode for all the columns
3.
  To improve the performance of the query when you know the type of the result, use the OfType<T>()
  ex:
  context.Employees.OfType<HourlyEmployee>().Single(e => e.Name == "Steven Fuller");

4. To search records use // Find() method
  It fetches entity from context object (if alredy data in cache it will retrive from there. if not not found in chace then goes to db)

5. Try to avoid let key word instead use where condition. (More refer - EntityFramework_Performance_General.txt)

2. EF5 and above is automatically caching the parameterised query plan

Create node module or create node package
----------------------------------------------
    Node can load the directory contents, as long as you organize the contents
in one of two ways.
    
    1) The FIRST way is to provide a package.json file with information about the
directory. The structure contains other information, but the two entries relevant
to packaging the module are name and main:
{ "name" : "mylibrary",
"main" : "./mymodule/mylibrary.js"
}
The first property, name, is the name of the module. The second, main, indicates
the entry point for the module.

   2) The SECOND way to load directory contents is to include either an index.js or
index.node file in the directory to serve as the main module entry point.


** To create package Only the name and version fields are required
** If you want to go online then Youâ€™ll need to provide a repository for your module, a URL for reporting
bugs, home page for the modules, and so on


properly export the functionalities which can be accessed by externals

then create the gzipped tarball of the module.

tarball is
one or more files archived together into one using a tar command



In addition to the normal package.json fields, we also need to add in a
directories field with a hash of folders, such as the previously mentioned
test and doc:
"directories" : {
"doc" : ".",
"test" : "test",
"example" : "examples"
}


Before publishing, the Guide recommends we test that the module can
cleanly install. To test for this, type the following in the root directory for the
module:
npm install . -g

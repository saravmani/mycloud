Advantages of Http client
--------------------------------------
1. # no need to convert json explicitly. it will automatically by default converts data
  into json
2. # we can tell HttpClient about type of object it is going to get
Ex:
export interface Config {
  heroesUrl: string;
  textfile: string;
}
getConfig() {
  // now returns an Observable of Config
  return this.http.get<Config>(this.configUrl);
}


An HttpClient method does not begin its HTTP request until you call subscribe()
on the observable returned by that method.

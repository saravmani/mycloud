Processes
-------------
1. foreground - notepad -- which ll have human interaction
2. background - ex: antivirus


top
---
tells all the running process

this will display process details in table format
and there ll be more columns in that table.
some of columns explained here
1. PR - prioritiy 
    this will vary from 20 to -20. 20 is highest -20 is lowest
2. VIRT - virtual mem used. in KB
3. RES - physical mem in KB
4. SHR - share mem used in KBytes
5. s - status
        D- un interptable sleep
        R - running
        S - Sleep

6. MEM - physical mem used
7. NI - nice value
Shared memory is a feature supported by UNIX System V, including Linux, SunOS and Solaris. One process must explicitly ask for an area, using a key, to be shared by other processes. This process will be called the server. All other processes, the clients, that know the shared area can access it.


PS (Process Status) command
-----------------
it is similar to windows Task Managers

ps ux  // display all the processes. it s similar to top command. but information showing is different
ps PID  // to get details of specific processes

pidof processname // this will give processes id
kill PID // kill the processes. if the process successfully killed it wont show any msg.


nice
---------------
we can set periority for the specific processes. this is called niceness .
it has value -20 to 19

Lower the niceness index higher would be the priority
default value is 0

nice -n 'nice value' process name // used to set the nice value
renice 'nice value' -p 'PID' // to re assign the porcesses nice value


ex: nice -n 19 banshee

MVC - Tasks On Work

Download MVC source code from net and try to debug it.
	routing module, mvc handler, action invoker
	https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetWebStack


create form page with validation errors
one custome validation,
model level validation (#After user clears all property level errors then only model level error will get displaied)
Self-validating model - IValidatableObject
(If the model class implements the IValidatableObject interface, then the Validate method will be called after
the model binder has assigned values to each of the model properties.)


Try FilePathResult,FileStreamResult,FileCOntentResult


Try Action with complex return type.


Try below example with JsonResult and JavaScriptResult

JavaScriptResult (try this )
------------------------
# I guess it is usded to call the client side javascript Method
# sb2 example... we can set the configurations like IsAdminUser,HavingReportAccessRights etc.,. based on roles we can abel to set the global variables.
# But what will happen if we use json result in below example?

[OutputCache(Duration = 999999)]
public virtual JavaScriptResult Global()
{
    var script = string.Format(@"
        MaxNotificaitonsToShow = {0};
        ItemsPerPage = 25;",
    GlobalSettings.MaxNotificaitonsToShow);
    return JavaScript(script);
}
And in the page footer I load the page:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/JS/Global"></script>
Now I can get the values in any Javascript file:

if(ItemsPerPage == 25)
{
   alert('it works!');
}


Try ajax.action and ajax.beginform
------------------------------------------------
@Ajax.ActionLink("Customer from Germany", // <-- Text to display

                 "Germany", // <-- Action Method Name

                 new AjaxOptions

                 {

                     UpdateTargetId="CustomerList", // <-- DOM element ID to update

                     InsertionMode = InsertionMode.Replace, // <-- Replace the content of DOM element

                     HttpMethod = "GET" // <-- HTTP method

                 })


try mvc 5 how action method with void
-------------------------------------------


Try output chace and add dynamic code in view and check only view is getting executed??
1. OutputCache
 [OutputCache(Duration=20)]
          public string Index()
          {
               return "The time is " +  DateTime.Now;

          }


Filters
=====================================
AcutionFilterAttribite, IActionFilter,ResultFilter .... try all the filters. and find below and more
1. what are the items we can able to change?
2. change input parameters before model binding?
3. action filter will get called before constructor? i.e for controller level filters
4. can we able to avoid calling this action filter?


Authentication filters
------------------------------
If the OnAuthentication sets a value for the Result property of the context object, then the MVC Framework will
call the OnAuthenticationChallenge method

OnAuthentication method to create a result that reports an authentication error to the user, which can
then be overridden by the OnAuthenticationChallenge method to challenge the user for credentials instead.

The MVC Framework calls the OnAuthenticationChallenge method one final time after the action method has been
executed, but before the ActionResult is returned and executed. This provides authentication filters an opportunity
to respond to the fact that the action has completed or even alter the result

Action Filters
-------------------------
The Canceled property will return true if another filter has canceled the request (by setting a value for the Result
property) since the time that the filterâ€™s OnActionExecuting method was invoked. The OnActionExecuted method will
still be called, but only so that it can tidy up and release any resources the filter was using.

# verify above  items


try [Override filters


try partial views with layout

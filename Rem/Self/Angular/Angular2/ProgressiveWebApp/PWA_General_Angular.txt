angular-cli.json
  "serviceWorker":true //enable it
  "assets":[]


Angular will not enable serviceWorker on development mode.. to avoid caching

but in prod mode it will be enabled

based on version of angular we may require to install service worker package
npm i --save-dev @angular/service-worker


when we have service worker installed with angualar,
we can notice few extra files generated while we build applicaiton in prod mode

angular will automatically generate manifest


ngsw-manifest.json - in dist folder u can find this
this is automatically generated. if u want to override then create the file in same
name on root and modify the rules in this file
ex: we can add routing rules.. if user type something then what should happen

ngsw-manifest.json file -- add all the js, assets and html in manifest to chache
icon, etc.,
if you want to remove any static asstes or any other file then we can
create "static.ignore" rule in override manifest file (ngsw-manifest.json - which we have to create mannually on root)


also it creates service work js file in output. this will get installed.

also in ngsw-manifest.json file it will maintain all the files hash to watch the changes

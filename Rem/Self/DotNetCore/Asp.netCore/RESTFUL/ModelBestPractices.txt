Below three models should not be equal for good design
--------------------------------------------------------
Business models
entity models
outer facing models(like view models)

To bind different models we can use AutoMappers (Nuget Package), instead manually
copy the properties from one to other

AutoMappers are object to object mapper. it is Nuget Package.
It is convention based. It will mapp the same propeties (which are having same name),
in different objects. and it will ignore null errors.
we can able to configure the auto mappers, like if is there any transform is needed

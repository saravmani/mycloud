to host node js in server we need root password. but most of the time we cant get this root pwd.

so another option is VPS (virtual private server).
But this includes setting up an email
system, and alternative web server, most likely Apache or Nginx, handle firewalls
and other security, email, etc

Cloude Hosting
---------------------
Nowadays, an application is just as likely to reside in a cloud server rather than
an individual or group’s own computers. Node applications are well-suited to
cloud-based implementations

advantage is You can focus specifically
on the Node application without having to worry about FTP or email
servers, or general server maintenance.

GIT
-----
Almost all transitioning of Node applications,
including pushing the applications to a cloud server, happens through Git.

Microsoft’s Azure cloud utilizes Git to push
the application from your local environment to the cloud, while Google’s Cloud
Platform provides a toolset to perform the same process


LINUX
-----------
In a Linux or OSX environment, you can also use a tool, the Node Version
Manager (nvm), to keep Node up to date.


The Node package manager (npm) updates more frequently than Node. To
upgrade just it, run the following command:
sudo npm install npm -g n




One thing to be aware of is the rather dramatic changes that have occurred
within Node as it progressed from 0.8 through the new 4.x.
To counter the problems
that can occur, you’ll need to install NAN, or Native Abstractions for
Node.js. This header file helps to smooth out the differences between the versions
of Node.js.

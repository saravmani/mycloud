Sdk attribute that specifies what
SDK to use for this project. Specifying the target framework can be done using the
TargetFramework element, which is .NET Core 2.0

** All files located in the same directory as the project file are included in the project
by default.
This behavior can be altered by specifying the patterns to include or exclude
using the Folder element. External dependencies, like other project references, external
tools, or NuGet packages, are defined inside an ItemGroup

Third party cookies
-------------------------
A third party cookie is one that you set for a different domain than the domain of the page you are currently on. 
Ex:
if you visit widgets.com and the domain of the cookie placed on your computer is widgets.com, then this is a first-party cookie. 
If, however, you visit widgets.com and the cookie placed on your computer says stats-for-free.com, then this is a third-party cookie.

Even though you may be able to set a 3rd party cookie for a different domain such as bbb.com, you cannot read that bbb.com cookie from a 
page in aaa.com, ever. Only pages from bbb.com can read that cookie.

Third-party cookies are often blocked and deleted through browser settings and security settings such as same origin policy;
 by default, Firefox blocks all third-party cookies.

This capability is sometimes used for tracking purposes by ad services to help in tracking a given user across multiple domains.
It can also be used to help share credentials across cooperating sites that use multiple domains.


persistent and non persistent cookies
--------------------------------------
If the cookie setter does not specify a date, the cookie is removed once the user quits his or her browser.

As a result, specifying a date is a way for making a cookie survive across sessions. For this reason, cookies with an expiration date are called persistent.


from the server we can able to set and clear the cookies in browser.
ex:
in node js
res.cookie('cookiename','value');// setting cookie in response header
res.clearCookie('cookiename');// clear cookie in browser. this will send cookiename with empty value and expiry date as 01 Jan 1070
when we try to clear the cookie in browser server will send the cookie with past expiry date.
# so browser will cleare the cookie immediatly

Advantages of ASP.NET MVC
---------------------------------
Beter use of seperation of concern

Extensibility
The MVC Framework is built as a series of independent components that satisfy a .NET interface or that are built
on an abstract base class. You can easily replace components, such as the routing system, the view engine, and the
controller factory, with a different one of your own implementation. In general, the MVC Framework gives you three
options for each component:
• Use the default implementation of the component as it stands (which should be enough for
most applications).
• Derive a subclass of the default implementation to tweak its behavior.
• Replace the component entirely with a new implementation of the interface or abstract base class.


Easy maintanable and testable
------------------------------
Easy Maintainable and testable because you
naturally separate different application concerns into independent pieces.
To support unit testing, they took the framework’s component-oriented design and made sure that each
separate piece is structured to meet the requirements of unit testing and mocking tools.

Testability is not only a matter of unit testing. ASP.NET MVC applications work well with UI automation testing
tools, too. You can write test scripts that simulate user interactions without needing to guess which HTML element
structures, CSS classes, or IDs the framework will generate, and you do not have to worry about the structure
changing unexpectedly.

Powerful Routing System

Can generate more meaningful URLs.Heps  search engines, user 
who saves url as favourites in browsers etc

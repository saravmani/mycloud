With XSLT you can transform an XML document into HTML.
XSLT is a declarative programming language, you write an XSLT stylesheet to transform XML to HTML or XML or plain text.

XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is the recommended style sheet language for XML.

XSLT is far more sophisticated than CSS. With XSLT you can add/remove elements and attributes to or from the output file. You can also rearrange and sort elements, perform tests and make decisions about which elements to hide and display, and a lot more.

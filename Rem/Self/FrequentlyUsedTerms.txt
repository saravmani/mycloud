Seperation of concern
Loosly and tightly coupling

Code First development
Data base first approch


thread starvation - In iis if all the threads in thread poll has in progress,
then thread starvation will ocuur. this means there is no thread in thread pool to handle new request
When this happens, the web server will start queuing new incoming requests. At some
point, the queue will fill up and any new requests will be rejected, returning an HTTP
503 (server too busy) status code.
Solution for this we can use asynchronous controller
Using an asynchronous controller does not change the amount of time the request will take. It
just frees up the thread executing the request so it can be allocated back into the
ASP.NET thread pool.
After invoking the
ASP.NET MVC action asynchronously, it returns the thread to the thread pool so it
can handle other requests.
The asynchronous operation executes on a different thread;
when it�s done it notifies ASP.NET. ASP.NET grabs a thread (which may be different
than the original thread) and invokes it to finish processing the request



Release Candidate (RC) is the build released internally to check if any critical problems have gone
 undetected into the code during the previous development period.
 Release candidates are NOT for production deployment, but they are for testing purposes only.


Hyper-V (tags - hyperv , hyperV ,hyper V, hyper - V)
Hyper-V in Windows and Windows Server can replace older hardware virtualization products from Microsoft, including Microsoft Virtual Server,
 Microsoft Virtual PC, and Windows Virtual PC.
 Hyper-V enables you to create and manage virtual machines and their resources. Each virtual machine is an isolated,
  virtualized computer system that can run its own operating system. The operating system that runs within a virtual machine is called a 
  guest operating system.


Operating-system-level virtualization is a server virtualization method in which the kernel of an operating system allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances, instead of just one. Such instances, which are sometimes called containers, software containers




Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. Quote of features from docker web page:

Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries � anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.[5]
Docker provides an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux.[6]
Docker, an open-source technology,

Interoperability (pronounced IHN-tuhr-AHP-uhr-uh-BIHL-ih-tee) is the ability of a system or a product to work with other systems or products without special effort on the part 
of the customer.

Portability is a characteristic attributed to a computer program if it can be used in an operating systems other than the one in which it was created without requiring major rework. Porting is the task of doing any work necessary to make the computer program run in the new environment.



SoC - Seperation of Concern (Concern means is aspect or part or feature)
	Concerns are the different aspects of software functionality. For instance, the "business logic" of software is a concern, and the interface through which a person uses this logic is another.
The separation of concerns is keeping the code for each of these concerns separate. Changing the interface should not require changing the business logic code, and vice versa.
Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is an excellent example of separating these concerns for better software maintainability.

SpiderMonkey
SpiderMonkey is the code name for the first JavaScript engine, written by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications, later released as open source and currently maintained by the Mozilla Foundation


What is bytecode
---------------------
as per my knowledge it is the code which generated by compiler.
It is  also termed portable code designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. 
In .Net JIT compilers are used to translate bytecode into machine code.


Wire Protocol
--------------------
In computer networking, a wire protocol refers to a way of getting data from point to point: A wire protocol is needed if more than one application has to interoperate. It generally refers to protocols higher than the physical layer.


Linting
--------
Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors.

what is cross-cutting
--------------------------
 cross-cutting features such as logging, exception handling, performance measurement, authentication and authorization.

Headless browser
------------------
A headless browser is a web browser without a graphical user interface. Headless browsers provide automated control of a web page in an environment similar 
to popular web browsers, but are executed via a command-line interface or using network communication.

Magnet URI
---------
Downloading Torrents Using Magnet Links. With magnet links, you no longer need to download a ".torrent" file to download a torrent. Magnet links have the same functionality as a ".torrent" file. To use magnet URIs, you need only ensure that your bittorrent client is associated with them.
The Magnet URI scheme, defines the format of magnet links, 
Although magnet links can be used in a number of contexts, they are particularly useful in peer-to-peer file sharing networks because they allow resources to be referred to without the need for a continuously available host, and can be generated by anyone who already has the file, without the need for a central authority to issue them. This makes them popular for use as "guaranteed" search terms within the file sharing community where anyone can distribute a magnet link to ensure that the resource retrieved by that link is the one intended, regardless of how it is retrieved.

BSD
-----
it is a licensing system for free open source softwares. REDIS is using this.
BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the use and redistribution of covered software.

MIT
-------
The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, an excellent license compatibility.

Staging server
-------------------
A staging server is a type of server that is used to test a software, website or service in a production-similar environment before being set live. It is part of a staging environment or staging site, where it serves as a temporary hosting and testing server for any new software or websites.
## i think it s like our UAT servers



Unicode
---------
8 bits. 32 bits.
UTF-8 is for 8 bits. 
if a character takes morethan 8 bits then it i will take another 8 bit also. so we can store all type of characters



ASCII
----------
7 bits
Maximum 7bits allowed for one character.
if character takes morethan 7bits then it cant save. Now a days ASCII characters are relplaced by unicode



pure function
----------------------
same input -> same output.
this output should not affect with any other factors.
No side effects.

even if we give the output based on 
other factors like other application stats then it is impure functions.


Pollifills
------------------
A polyfill is a browser fallback, made in JavaScript, that allows functionality you expect to work in modern browsers to work in older browsers, e.g., to support canvas (an HTML5 feature) in older browsers.


Pyramid Doom
----------------
callback spaghetti or Pyramid Doom
in javascript , node js  we ll have multip call backs to handle asnychronous function resutls.
this is called pyramid doom. it is difficult to maintain and understand
 


 REPL, or read-eval-print loop.
 it is command line to to execute the code and check. 
 ex: in node js we can simply type node in command prompt and start using repel 


 sokcet
 ---------
it is endpoint communication
# it is used to make a conneciton. imagine it is a plugg point. it is used to make connection between
table fan and CUrrent connection


Interoperability
----------------
Capability of different programs to exchange data via a common set of exchange formats, to read and write the same file formats, and to use the same protocols.

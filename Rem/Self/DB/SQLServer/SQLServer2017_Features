 Automatic Tuning.
 --------------------
 SQL Server introduces a differed join selection within plans where the optimizer
 will take a new count of the rows coming across the plan and decide at that point after
 it's already created the plan which type of join it should do whether that's nested loop or hash.
 The differed join selection will change from nested loops to hash tables and vice versa based on statistics that
 are available from within the query and this is part of a new set of features in SQL Server 2017 called Automatic Tuning.

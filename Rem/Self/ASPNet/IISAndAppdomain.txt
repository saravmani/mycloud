In one w3wp process, multiple web applications can be hosted and each of them is running in its own appdomain. 
Asp.net runs some code in default domain to manage those appdomains. e.g. create/unload domain, monitor process memory 

User code cant access Defualt appdomain of ASP.NET
The ASP.NET runtime does however use the default AppDomain for some things but it creates a specific AppDomain for running user code. 
That's why IsDefaultAppDomain returns false

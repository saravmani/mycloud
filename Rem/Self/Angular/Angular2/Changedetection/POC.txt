My POC on change detection process
----------------------------------------
Assume input for a component is array.
if array reference itself changes then "ngOnChanges" called
but if any one of the array element's value got changed then "ngOnChanges" not called
but view is getting updated properly, if we used this input in template.

#why because my assemption is , when ever change detection triggers, view also got checked

One important note: If you're using Ionic 5+ (i.e. NOT Ionic version 4), you need to use CSS
classes instead of the utility attributes I use in the videos.

For example:

<h1 text-center>...</h1>
  becomes

<h1 class="ion-text-center>...</h1>
That's all!

You can check your package.json file to find out which version you're working with.

Affected are all styling utility attributes like text-center, text-left, no-padding, padding, margin etc.

They would need to be changed to class="ion-text-center", class="ion-text-left", class="ion-no-padding" etc.

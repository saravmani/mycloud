The normal way of using filters is to apply attributes. But there is an alternative.
The Controller class implements the IAuthenticationFilter, IAuthorizationFilter,
IActionFilter, IResultFilter, and IExceptionFilter interfaces
#This also provides empty virtual methods for all. 
But we cant put the common code bcs we have to re-use the code.


This technique is most useful when you are creating a base class from which multiple 
controllers in your project
are derived. The whole point of filtering is to put code that is required 
across the application in one reusable location



Using Global Filters
----------------------------------
Global filters are applied to all of the action methods in all of the controllers in your application


public class FilterConfig {
public static void RegisterGlobalFilters(GlobalFilterCollection filters) {
filters.Add(new HandleErrorAttribute());
}
}

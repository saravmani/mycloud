ex:
Class Bird
{
 public IBehaviour objBehaviour{get;set;}// run time we can able to assign functionality

 public void PerformAction()
 {
     this.objBehaviour.DoFly();

 }

}



inheritance
=======================
Advantages of inheritance
-------------------------------
Extensibility -- extending the base class logic as per business logic of the derived class
Reusability -- facility to use public methods of base class without rewriting the same
Overriding--With inheritance, we will be able to override the methods of the base class so that meaningful  implementation of the base class method can be designed in the derived class.
# can be Used for OCP - in particular implementation if we want to do override the extending functionality we can do...
# Used in template pattern , Factory Method pattern
# Used in abstraction pattern ex: weapon.attack, gun.attack and gun.load etc.,
# Using run time polymorphism, we can able to add change the functionality at runtime
  Code reusability increased through inheritance.

disadvantages of inheritance
------------------------------------
 two classes (base and inherited class) get tightly coupled.

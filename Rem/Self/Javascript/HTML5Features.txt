Local Storage
var localStorage = window.localStorage;	
 localStorage.setItem("Name", "John");
console.log(localStorage.getItem("Name"));
//or
console.log(localStorage.key(0));
//Local storage will save data in alphabetical order. so if we use key(0) it will give result based on alphabet. not based on storage

localStorage.removeItem("Project");
localStorage.clear()//Clear all
localStorage.length()//Show storage count

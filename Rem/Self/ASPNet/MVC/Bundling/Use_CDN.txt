Where ever possible try to use CDN.
Advantages of CDN is
1. Jquery, Bootstraps are used by many websites from CDN. so if our website also
uses CDN, then already cached files (when users already used in other websites), 
will be loaded from browser itself

to use CDN in MVC we can use bundlers

bundle.UseCdn = true
bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/jqueryval","//google.cdmn.jquery.js").
include("~scripts/jquery.js"));
//and in web.config 
<system.web><compilation debug="false"


If CDN is down then it will refer local 

//google.cdmn.jquery.js
// // Means it can use HTTP or https based on page loaded

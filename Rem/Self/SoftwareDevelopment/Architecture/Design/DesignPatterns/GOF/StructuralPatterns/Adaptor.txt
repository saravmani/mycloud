 # third party class may have different formate (methods, properties) etc.
 But for our project structure all the components using different interface.
 so we have to create adaptor class which implements the interface and use the third party class within the adaptor class

 Ex:
 our application knows
 ILoggerrrrr
      DoLog

third party
  Logg4Nett
      HahaLog


AdaptorClassForLogg4Nett:ILoggerrrrr
  DoLog()
  {
    Logg4Nett.HahaLog
  }

Advantages
  tomorrow if we want to use different thirpary we can simply use different Adaptor

It looks like strategy pattern. But strategy pattern used for defining different algorithms

The .NET Core Framework comes with a new runtime for application execution called CoreCLR

## my understanding is - there are two main parts in .net core
one is CLI (only for tooling), another one is CLR (Runtime)


no separate items for webapi and mvc.
Both are combined into one as "Asp.net Core MVC"

ASP.NET Core consists of an embedded web server (Kestrel) and a runtime environment that runs the application code.
Kestrel can be exposed directly outside
## i think Kestrel is reside inside aps.net core related dlls

Across ASP.NET Core we will notice that dependencies and configurations conform
to a certain Add/Use style by first defining what is required and then how it is used.

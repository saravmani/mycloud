I set expiry time as 1 min.
but after authenticated, i keep on accessing the system. But Authentication was successfull at each time.
But this is possible?
when token reaches near to expiry time , server will create new token and set in cookie.. :-)

my doubt still what will happen if objAuthentication.SignOut() call?

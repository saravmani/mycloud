ASP.NET Core MVC will ignore the Accept header by default and respond with the standard configured
format. This behavior is to keep things a bit more consistent across the board but can
be overridden by explicitly setting the RespectBrowserAcceptHeader to true in the MvcOptions.

# but i remember, in Webapi 2.0 (clasic asp.net), asp.net will repond based on Accept Header
# i tried this with post man

Content negotiation makes it possible to serve responses from the same action
method in different formats.
services.AddMvc(options =>
{
  options.OutputFormatters.Add(new XmlSerializerOutputFormatter());
});

default supported formaters are JSON, XML

Ambient
-----------------
Ambient files will not contain the implementations, it is just type declarations. 
Ambient declarations are a way of telling the TypeScript compiler that the actual source code exists elsewhere. 
When you are consuming a third party js libraries like jquery you can’t rewrite it in TypeScript. 
SO to Ensuring typesafety and intellisense while using these libraries will be challenging for a TypeScript programmer. To avoid this Ambient declarations help to seamlessly work with other js libraries into TypeScript.


Ambient declarations are by convention kept in a type declaration file with following extension (d.ts)

ex:
jquery.d.ts
Abvoe  file will not be transcompiled to JavaScript. It will be used only for type safety and intellisense. 


Ambient code 
ex:
declare module TutorialPoint { 
   export class Calc { 
      doSum(limit:number) : number; 
   }
}

ambient files can be referenced in type script file like below
/// <reference path = " Sample.d.ts" />

XMLHttpRequest Level 2
----------------------------
XMLHttpRequest Level 2 specifi cation introduces the FormData type
var data = new FormData(document.forms[0]); //thiss will serialize the form
data.append(�name�, �Nicholas�); this will append the data
we can directly use this in ajax
xhr.open(�post�, �postexample.php�, true);
var form = document.getElementById(�user-info�);
xhr.send(new FormData(form));


Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) --  is a W3C specification for cross domain access.
Browser should send Origin off current page to the 3rd party server.
third party can validate and send the response with Access controll header

Request Header: Origin: http://www.fromdomain.com
Response Header from 3rd party: Access-Control-Allow-Origin:http://www.fromdomain.com

If this header is missing, or the origins don't match, then the browser disallows the request. If all
is well, then the browser processes the request.


POST requests have more overhead associated with them than do GET requests.
In terms of performance, GET requests can be up to two times faster than POST
requests sending the same amount of data.

Once used XHR object we have deference it. dont try to re use. bcs this cause memory issue

By default, the following headers are sent when an XHR request is sent:
Accept � The content types that the browser can handle.
Accept-Charset � The character sets that the browser can display.
Accept-Encoding � The compression encodings handled by the browser.
Accept-Language � The languages the browser is running in.
Connection � The type of connection the browser is making with the server.
Cookie � Any cookies set on the page.
Host � The domain of the page making the request.
Referer � The URI of the page making the request. Note that this header is spelled incorrectly
in the HTTP specifi cation and so must be spelled incorrectly for compatibility purposes.
(The correct spelling of this word is �referrer�.)
User-Agent � The browser�s user-agent string.




Internet Explorer 7+, Firefox, Opera, Chrome, and Safari all support a native XHR object that can
be created using the XMLHttpRequest constructor as follows:
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
if (xhr.readyState == 4){
if ((xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) || xhr.status == 304){
alert(xhr.responseText);
} else {
alert(�Request was unsuccessful: � + xhr.status);
}
}
};

xhr.timeout = 1000; //set timeout for 1 second (IE 8+ only)
xhr.ontimeout = function(){
alert(�Request did not return in a second.�);
};
xhr.overrideMimeType(�text/xml�);//it wont support in older browsers. if we set like this then response will be treated like XML even response is not XML.
//so xhr.responseXML will have the data
xhr.open(�get�, �example.txt�, false);
xhr.setRequestHeader(�MyHeader�, �MyValue�);
xhr.send(null);

xhr.abort();//Cancel the request


If no body data needs to be sent, you must pass in null, because this argument is required for some
browsers.


responseText � The text that was returned as the body of the response.
responseXML � Contains an XML DOM document with the response data if the response
has a content type of �text/xml� or �application/xml�.
status � The HTTP status of the response.
statusText � The description of the HTTP status.

xhr.readyState

0� Uninitialized. The open() method hasn�t been called yet.
1 � Open. The open() method has been called but send() has not been called.
2 � Sent. The send() method has been called but no response has been received.
3 � Receiving. Some response data has been retrieved.
4 � Complete. All of the response data has been retrieved and is available.

You can access only URLs that exist on the same origin, which means the same
domain, using the same port, and with the same protocol. If the URL specifi es any
of these differently than the page making the request, a security error is thrown.




CORS
--------------
XHR (except IE)

Image pings
JSONP


Image pings-> we can make a call to third party server by img tags to call third party domain.
here client can send data by query string. but they cannot receive the response. so it is one way communication
var img = new Image();
img.onload = img.onerror = function(){
alert(“Done!”);
};
img.src = “http://www.example.com/test?name=Nicholas”;

JSONP->JsonP works wih Script Tag.  like img tag script tag works with other domains without restriction.
JSONP is short for “JSON with padding”.
JSONP looks just like JSON except that the data is wrapped within what looks
like a function call. For example:
callback({ “name”: “Nicholas” });
Ex: http://freegeoip.net/json/?callback=handleResponsess

function handleResponse(response){
alert(“You’re at IP address “ + response.ip + “, which is in “ +
response.city + “, “ + response.region_name);
}
var script = document.createElement(“script”);
script.src = “http://freegeoip.net/json/?callback=handleResponse”;
//in server we have to use callback query parameter, and we have to send back the script like it should call the client function.
ex: server response - handleResponse({'name':'sarvmani'});
document.body.insertBefore(script, document.body.firstChild);

function handleResponse(data)
{
alert(data.name);
}

These days (2015), CORS is the recommended approach vs. JSONRequest. JSONP is still useful for older browser support, but given the security implications, 
unless you have no choice CORS is the better choice.

Advantage of JSONP over Image Ping is, here we can able to send and receive the data.
Disadvantage is
If that domain isn’t trusted, it could very easily swap the response for something more malicious
The second downside is that there is no easy way to determine that a JSONP request has failed
  but we use timeout technique but all the end users will not have same band width right :-)


  Comet
  ------------
  AJAX is clinet requesting server. Here COMET is server pushing to client
  There are two popular approaches to Comet:
long polling and streaming.
Long Poling ->we can do a long poling with setTimeout().
browsers support this through the XHR object and using setTimeout().

HTTP Streaming ->The second popular approach for Comet is HTTP streaming. Streaming is different than either
polling technique, because it uses a single HTTP connection for the entire lifetime of the page.
The browser sends a request to the server and the server holds that connection open, periodically
sending data through the connection to the server.
we can get the server data by listening for the readystatechange event and focusing on readyState 3. A readyState of 3
will fi re periodically in all of these browsers as data is being received from the server.
readyState is 4,the fi nished callback is executed and the entire content of the response is passed in

function createStreamingClient(url, progress, finished){
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(),
received = 0;
xhr.open(“get”, url, true);
xhr.onreadystatechange = function()
{
var result;
if (xhr.readyState == 3){
//get only the new data and adjust counter
result = xhr.responseText.substring(received);
received += result.length;
//call the progress callback
progress(result);
} else if (xhr.readyState == 4){
finished(xhr.responseText);
}
};
xhr.send(null);
return xhr;
}

SSE
----
one-way HTTP connection  server can pass as much or as little information as necessary.
SSE supports short polling, long polling, and HTTP streaming
automatically determines when to reconnect to the server if it gets disconnected
var source = new EventSource(“myevents.php”);
source.onmessage = function(event){
var data = event.data;
//do something with the data
};
//if we want to close the connection we call source.close();
By default, the EventSource object will attempt to keep the connection alive with the server. If
the connection is closed, a reconnect is attempted. This means that Server-Sent Events work with
long polling and HTTP streaming


WebSockets
-----------------
for websockets server also should support.
Initially client will make http request, to check the availability of websockets.
websocket uses custom.  protocal is -
ws://    - for unsecured connection
wss://   - for secured connection
var socket = new WebSocket(“ws://www.example.com/server.php”);
The same-origin policy
does not apply to Web Sockets, so you can open a connection to any site.




When an unauthorized system is able to access a resource, it is considered a cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) attack.







IE6 and below
--------------------
ActiveX controll used for ajax purpose

//function for IE versions prior to 7
function createXHR(){
if (typeof arguments.callee.activeXString != �string�){
var versions = [�MSXML2.XMLHttp.6.0�, �MSXML2.XMLHttp.3.0�,
�MSXML2.XMLHttp�],
i, len;
for (i=0,len=versions.length; i < len; i++){
try {
new ActiveXObject(versions[i]);//if throws exception .21
arguments.callee.activeXString = versions[i];
break;
} catch (ex){
//skip
}
}
}
return new ActiveXObject(arguments.callee.activeXString);
}

For every property that is added to the /src/app/environment.ts, 
it must be added to the files in /config/environment.{env}.ts, this is a disruptive workflow.


adding new type of environment is possible.
---------------------------------------------
 "environments": {
    "dev": "environments/environment.ts",
    "prod": "environments/environment.prod.ts",
    "qa": "environments/environment.qa.ts"
  }


#build
$ ng build --environment=production
#shorthand
$ ng b -prod

#serve
$ ng serve --environment=production
#shorthand
$ ng s -prod



add new property in environemnt variables
--------------------------------------------------
export const environment = {  
  production: false,
  envName: 'dev'
};



Usage of environment variable 
-----------------------------------
import { Component } from '@angular/core';  
import { environment } from './environment';
@Component({
  moduleId: module.id,
  templateUrl: 'myapp.component.html'
})
export class MyappAppComponent {   
  environmentName = environment.envName;
}


# i have done a poc. created new file *.haha.ts ..
and tried with below command it works fine
$ ng serve --environment=production

but if try like ng serve --haha ... this approch not wokring properly.

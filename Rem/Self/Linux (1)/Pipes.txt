Use pipes to run two commands consecutively

ex:
cat filename | less  // this command will shows page by page
//in msdos we can do this with below commands
dir /p    -- indicates paging
dir|more -- it will show line by line

dir| pg
dir| more


grep command used for text search
-----------------------------------------
cat filename | grep string to search
cat filename | grep -i string to search

like this many pipes we can used

sort
----------
 sort command used for sorting


output of filter 1 s first command can be input for another
ex:
cat filename.txt | grep -v a | sort -r

above will search the letter a in filename.txt and then sort it in reverse order

CLRHosting
-------------
Basically, the CLR acts as a library that can be loaded and "hosted" by a process. You can develop an app that loads and hosts the CLR if you wish; that would allow your app to contain a whole CLR virtual machine, load assemblies and run .NET managed code all within it.
SQL Server 2008, for example, can do this. You can write .NET code that is stored in a SQL Server database and run from within the SQL Server database engine. SQL Server is hosting the CLR to achieve that.


How does Windows know that a binary is a .NET application? Actually the answer varies depending on which version of Windows you run.
Normally .exe files are executed by Windows by looking at the PE-Header. This PE-Header says how it should be loaded into memory, what dependencies it has, and where the entry point is.

Azure Active Directory (AAD)
-----------------------------
When hosting applications in the cloud, we can leverage the power of Azure Active
Directory (AAD) to act as a gatekeeper for protecting secure resources. ASP.NET
Core has native integration with AAD by making use of Bearer authentication. Azure
also offers Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C), which is a cloud identity-management
solution for web applications that have a minimal configuration for
authenticating against social, enterprise, and local accounts.

Issue:
---------
unable to attach to process from windbg.

Solution:
if you running debug diag and is there any active rule, this problem may occur.
I tried to run the debugger as administrator. I closed all my programs and then I rebooted my machine but nothing helped.
In the end I learned something new.
That was that even if you restart the machine when you have an active rule running in Debug Diag this rule will auto activate after the reboot
even if you have not restarted the Debug Diag tool.

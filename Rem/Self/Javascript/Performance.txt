Chrome was the fi rst browser to introduce
an optimizing engine that compiles JavaScript into native code. Sin

reduce scope chain. bcs if chain size increase thn search also will get increase
It is always slower to access a global variable than it is to
access a local variable, because the scope chain must be traversed


Global variables and functions are always more expensive to use than local
ones because they involve a scope chain lookup

Ex: 
If we use document object directly in many places will give performance hit. bcs
it will do scope chain lookup

to avoid this we do like this

function fn()
{
var doc = document;
//use doc variale insteed of directly using document object.
}


The with statement should be avoided where performance is important
because of the extra steps in the scope chain lookup.

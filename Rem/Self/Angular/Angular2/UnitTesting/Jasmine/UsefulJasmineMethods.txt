toBeDefined() This method asserts that the result has been defined.
toBeUndefined() This method asserts that the result has not been defined.
toBeNull() This method asserts that the result is null.
toBeTruthy() This method asserts that the result is truthy, as described in Chapter 12.
toBeFalsy() This method asserts that the result is falsy, as described in Chapter 12.
toContain(substring) This method asserts that the result contains the specified substring.

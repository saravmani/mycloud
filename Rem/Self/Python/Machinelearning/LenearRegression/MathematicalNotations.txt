Dependant variable, Independent variable

Standard deviation - Vertical Distance btn Actual data point and Regression line
  G:\rem\Rem\Self\Python\ImageRef\StandardDeviation.png
  also this called - Residuals (Error)

Best regression model should give (model should draw best fitting line)
  sum of square of this residuals should be as less as possible
SSE - Summ of squares of residuals


Why Square root of Residuals required?
    1. It will convert all the negative values into positive
    2. sum of square of this residuals should be as less as possible to say the model will draw best fitting line


Multi co llinearity (Multicollinearity) -
  # some times Independent variables not only related to Dependant variable. Those Independent variables relates among them

OverFItting
  # using more indipendent variables which are not relavent. so the predictions will not be more perfect

Vector vs Matrix
  Vector - single column row  - ex: a = [13,52,63,74]
  matrix is a normal matrix.
  In machine learning we should not use vector as Dependant. if so we have to convert that to matrix first
    Refer - Udemy:Machine learning A-Z, Book Mark : "Why no vector should be used?"

ng-app is the directive used by the angularjs to find which part of the html is
angular application.

we can use it anywhere. if we want to use it for whole html page then we need to adde it in root element of the html document
<html ng-app>

we have to put angular js script tage inside of the header tag.
so that when loading time anuglar will look for angular tags

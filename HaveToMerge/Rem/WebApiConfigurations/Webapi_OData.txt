The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a data access protocol for the web. OData provides a uniform way to query and manipulate data sets through CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete).


ASP.NET Web API supports both v3 and v4 of the protocol. You can even have a v4 endpoint that runs side-by-side with a v3 endpoint.


namespace ProductService.Models
{
    public class Product
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
        public string Category { get; set; }
    }
}

The Id property is the entity key. Clients can query entities by key. For example, to get the product with ID of 5, the URI is /Products(5). The Id property will also be the primary key in the back-end database.

Note: Web API OData does not require EF. Use any data-access layer that can translate database entities into models.

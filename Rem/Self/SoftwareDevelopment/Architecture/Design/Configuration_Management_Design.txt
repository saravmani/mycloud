How the enterprice congiruaton manager should be?
	1. Should have multiple levels. Sub levels can be override parent -ex: Global level,Institution level, user level etc
	2. Should have Module level grouping
	3. Culture Specific
	2. Should be centeralised for all applications in enterprice applications. Ex: Common WCF applications should be consumed by all other apps
	3. Should be common way to access the configuraion (ex: Common UTIL class (proj or dell) which should have caching mechanism) 
	3. Enterprice specific (Global), Application specific, User specific
	4. even further we can have configuration settings in environment level 
			ex: DR site, Primary site, Low end server, Hight end server ect.,, Linux machine, windows machine :-)
	
	
what are the input params required for COmmon UTIL DLL?
	1. Config Key
	2. Application ID
	3. Module Id
	3. User Id
	4. EnvironmentId (ex: DR or primary)
	5. Culture Info
	
	
	Table design
	------------------
	ConfigId (unique key)
	ApplicationId
	ModuleId
	ConfigKey
	ConfigValue
	Is_Culture_Specific  (if true  then it will have multiple ConfigValues. And those we can store in other tables)
	Status 
	
	
	Culture Specif Values
	-------------------------
	ConfigId
	ConfigValue
	Status

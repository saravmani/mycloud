tips and tricks that increase stability and
maximize performance,

In application deployment we have to consider below
1. performance
2. Availability
3. Monitoring


Deployment Options
--------------------
Dedicated servers
    Dedicated servers are usually more expensive than virtual servers and often
require more setup time because components may have to be ordered, assembled,
and configured. Virtual private servers (VPSs), on the other hand, can be set up
quickly because they’re created inside preexisting physical servers.

Viritual Private servers
     Virtual servers run inside physical servers and are assigned a share of the
physical server’s RAM, processing power, and disk space
VPSs are a good hosting solution for web applications if you don’t anticipate quick
growth in usage. VPSs are cheap and can easily be allocated additional resources,
when needed, such as disk space and RAM.
VPSs, like dedicated servers, can’t usually be created on demand. Nor can they handle
quick growth in usage, because that requires the ability to quickly add more servers
without relying on human intervention. To handle such requirements, you’ll need
to use cloud hosting.

General purpose cloud servers
    Cloud servers are similar to VPSs in that they’re virtual emulations of dedicated servers.
But they have an advantage over dedicated servers and VPSs in that their management
can be fully automated. Cloud servers can be created, stopped, started, and
destroyed using a remote interface or API.
Cloud server advantage is creation and destruction of an application’s servers can be automated by programming.
DISADVANTSGE: The downside to using cloud servers is that they tend to be more expensive than VPSs
and can require some knowledge specific to the cloud platform

manage the starting and stopping of any Linux application, including Node applications.

we can say Object diagrams represent an instance of a class diagram. Object diagrams also 
represent the static view of a system but this static view is a 
SNAPSHOT of the system at a particular moment.

 set of objects and their relationships as an instance.

Diff btn class and object diagrams 
 The difference is that a class diagram represents an abstract model consisting of classes and their relationships.
 However, an object diagram represents an instance at a particular moment, which is concrete in nature.
 both diagrams are made of same basic elements but in different form.
 
 In class diagram elements are fixed. but in object diagram based on moment count may vary.
 but when we draw we have to consider the objects which are having impact on the system
 and 
 consider only those instances, which will cover the functionality.
 
 Purpose
 -----------
 It means the object diagram is closer to the actual system behavior. The purpose is to capture the static view of a system at a particular moment.
 
 we can use it for rever engineering

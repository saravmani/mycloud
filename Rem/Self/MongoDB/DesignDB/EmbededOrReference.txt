When determining the schema for your database you will come across places where you need
to choose how much data to include within each of your documents.

Mongo DB supports, as I mentioned, a hundred levels of depth for your documents.
Obviously, this could become quite unwieldy and very deep data structures can in fact slow your indexing, access, and storage.

Embedded data
-----------------
 Embedded documents are a simpler interface to work with. Inserting documents into a single collection minimizes the number of operations.
 Embedded documents are easier to query and index.
For a simple document structure like this, it makes sense to embed the related data into the document itself


Separate collections
--------------------------------
 Separate collections, on the other hand, require more work.
 Inserting data must be done in each appropriate collection.
Reference ID's need to be used to access appropriate items.
And aggregating related data can require multiple operations.

When to go for seperate collections (reference)
When deciding on a strategy, it's important to figure out what the use cases are you're trying to support.
Anytime you'll be reusing an object in multiple places,
it's worth considering whether you should break that information out into a separate collection. 
While it's true that you need to perform extra steps to get the information you want,
it also protects you from the problem of maintaining identical information in multiple places.

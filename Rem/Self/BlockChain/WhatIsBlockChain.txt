It is distributed database

Think it is a large wold wide computer
every one can access the data  and execute
transactional code

all transactions are stored in blocks of data

block chain is not the place to store the 
large data. ex: instead of storing image,
we can able to check that wether image is
tamperd or not

No central control
It is a global Singleton


we cannt alter or remove the functionality or code block
from block chain

hashing algorithm used in block chain is
SHA 256

SHA is familiy of hasihg algorithms

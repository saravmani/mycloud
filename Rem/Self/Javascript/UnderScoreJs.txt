Underscore is a JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful functional programming helpers without 
extending any built-in objects. It’s the answer to the question: “If I sit down in front of a blank HTML page, and want to start being productive
 immediately, what do I need?” … and the tie to go along with jQuery's tux and Backbone's suspenders.


we can use it for paging, of collections

_take(arrayObject,1,2).. like this. but this is not correct syntax

_.debounce(function(){},300);
this will call the funciton in 300 ms delay. in middle if this code execute again, this wont call the function secondtime within 300 ms.
this we can use it for quick search text boxes. there users will type fastly.

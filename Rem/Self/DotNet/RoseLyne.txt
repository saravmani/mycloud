Visual Studio 2015 is taking full advantage of .NET Compiler Platform, also known as Roslyn. Many of the code editor functionalities are implemented using Roslyn public API: from automatic code formatting and coloring; to IntelliSense, code navigation and refactoring.

Since the full public API is available as open source, other integrated development environments are already switching from their internal implementations, to using Roslyn as the engine powering the advanced code editor features. At the time of writing, preview versions of Xamarin Studio and Mono Develop are available with .NET compiler platform already integrated.
To bring the power of Roslyn to other text editors that do not run on .NET and cannot host Roslyn in process, OmniSharp project has been brought to life. It is a cross-platform wrapper around Roslyn, exposing its API across HTTP. This makes it accessible to any text editor, and there are already integrations available for many popular programming text editors of today: Atom, Brackets, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and others.

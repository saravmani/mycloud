ad hoc queries
----------------
 You can ask the database any question, without taking the time to set up a query structure ahead of time.
 This distinguishes it from other document databases like CouchDB, and can greatly speed development and prototyping.

 When using ad hoc queries, performance can really suffer as the document list grows,
 because the database checks every document against the query structure, even when the data is really simple.
 For instance, if you have a database full of people's names. Without an index, in order to return a single item,
 the database needs to examine all items in the collection, and this takes a significant amount of time.
 Mongo supports all of the standard indexing functionality you've likely seen in relational databases.

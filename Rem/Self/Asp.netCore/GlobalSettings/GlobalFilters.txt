 filter can be added to the pipeline at one of three scopes. You can add a filter to a particular action method or
 to a controller class by using an attribute. Or you can register a filter globally for all controllers and actions.
 Filters are added globally by adding it to the MvcOptions.Filters collection in ConfigureServices:

NOTE:
Exception filters are good for trapping exceptions that occur within MVC actions,
but they're not as flexible as error handling middleware.
Prefer middleware for the general case, and use filters only where you need to do error handling
differently based on which MVC action was chosen.

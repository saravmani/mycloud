using(SampleDbEntities db = new SampleDbEntities())
{
var employees = db.Employees
.Where(employee => employee.LastName == "Singh");
}

//by default output is IQueriable<Employee>

It's also possible to specify the precise output type of our query by
specifying the type of the return variable such as IQueryable<Employee> or
IEnumerable<Employee>.

using(SampleDbEntities db = new SampleDbEntities())
{
IEnumerable<Employee> employees = db.Employees
.Where(employee => employee.LastName == "Singh");

Asp.net Core Supports 6 different log providers
1. ConsoleLoggerProvider
2. DebugLogprovider - display debug
3. EventSource -  AddEventSourceLogger --windows only (full .NET 4.6 framework needed)
4. TraceLisener - AddTraceSource --windows only (full .NET 4.6 framework needed)
The Trace Listener provider allows us to log to a variety of trace listeners, such as
the TextWriterTraceListener; we can add it by calling the AddTraceSource method on
ILoggingBuilder. The EventLog and Trace Listener providers are Windows-only and require
your application to target the full .NET 4.6 framework. If the application targets
operating systems other than Windows, one should make use of #if definitions.
5. Azure App Service
  If an application is deployed to Azure as an app service, it automatically gets
configured with the Azure App Service logging provider. All that we need to do is turn
it on inside the Azure portal. This provider does not affect when we run the application
locally and will only work within the Azure environment.
6. Other third party providers - NLog,JSNLog,Elmah.IO

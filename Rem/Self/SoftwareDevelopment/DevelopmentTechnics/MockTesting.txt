MOQ is a mock testing framework to mock the part of the application.
we can able to do modular testing also with this.

in this, we can by pass the certain module.

ex:

public void main()
{
var objMailComponent = new MailComponent();
objMailComponent.sendMail();//this can be mocked

//other code
}
	public class MailComponent()
{
public virtual void sendMail()//the methods should be virtual then only MOQ can override this method
{}
}


Test application
----------------
public void test()
{
Mock<MailComponentt> objMockcomp= new Mock<MailComponentt> ();
objMockcomp.setup(x=>x.sendMail()).Returns(true);
}

The Properties Common to All DOM Event Objects
--------------------------------------------------
timestamp - This property returns a number that contains the time that the event was triggered,
            expressed as milliseconds since January 1, 1970.
target - This property returns the object that triggered the event, which will generally be the
        object that represents the HTML element in the DOM.
type - This property returns a string that identifies the type of event that has been triggered


$event.target.value
-----------------------------
{{selectedProduct}}
<input class="form-control" (input)="selectedProduct=$event.target.value" />

//this assigns user input value into selectedProduct varaible

The event object is assigned to a template variable called $event,

The input element is represented in the DOM by an HTMLInputElement object, which defines a value
property that can be used to get and set the contents of the input element.
# here target is dom object of the element

The input event is triggered when the user edits the contents of the input element, so the componentâ€™s
selectedProduct property is updated with the contents of the input element after each keystroke. As the
user types into the input element, the text that has been entered is displayed at the top of the browser
window using the string interpolation binding.

<input  class="form-control" (input)="inputVarable = $event.target.value" />
{{inputVarable}}
# above code will print the user input on each key stroke

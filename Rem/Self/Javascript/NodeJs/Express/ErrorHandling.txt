Error Handling in Node JS
------------------------------
In Node, anything that inherits from EventEmitter has the potential of emitting
an error event.
A stream, like fs.ReadStream, is simply a specialized EventEmitter
that contains predefined events such as data and end, which we’ve already looked at.
By default, error events will be thrown when no listeners are present. This means that
if you don’t listen for these errors, they’ll crash your server.


Example error handler
----------------------
// error handler
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  // set locals, only providing error in development
  res.locals.message = err.message;
  res.locals.error = req.app.get('env') === 'development' ? err : {};

  // render the error page
  res.status(err.status || 500);
  res.render('error');
});

module.exports = app;

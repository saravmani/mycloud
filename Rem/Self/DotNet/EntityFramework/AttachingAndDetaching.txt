In the Entity Framework, objects can be attached to or detached from an object context.
Objects that are attached to an object context are tracked and managed by that object context.
Detached objects are not referenced by the object context, and their resources
can be reclaimed by the .NET Framework.

When a query is executed inside an object context in the Entity Framework,
the returned objects are automatically attached to the object context.
You can also attach objects to an object context that are obtained from a source other than a query.
(ex: get form data from UI)
You might attach objects that have been previously detached, objects that have been returned by a
NoTracking (AsNoTracking()) query, or objects that have been obtained outside the object context.

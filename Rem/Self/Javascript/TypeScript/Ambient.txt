Ambient
-----------------
Ambient files will not contain the implementations, it is just type declarations.
Ambient declarations are a way of telling the TypeScript compiler that the actual source code exists elsewhere.
When you are consuming a third party js libraries like jquery you can't rewrite it in TypeScript.
SO to Ensuring typesafety and intellisense while using these libraries will be challenging for a TypeScript programmer.
To avoid this Ambient declarations help to seamlessly work with other js libraries into TypeScript.


Ambient declarations are by convention kept in a type declaration file with following extension (d.ts)

ex:
jquery.d.ts
Abvoe  file will not be transcompiled to JavaScript. It will be used only for type safety and intellisense.


Ambient code
ex:
declare module TutorialPoint {
   export class Calc {
      doSum(limit:number) : number;
   }
}

ambient files can be referenced in type script file like below
/// <reference path = " Sample.d.ts" />

How to choose the packages
---------------------------
See 
	last release date
	number of bugs open
	number of downloades
	check what are the open issues

git hub
check in git hub, check how many stars it is having
how many fork it is having
check contibutions

actually we have to look how active that particular packages





NPM - Commands
--------------------
npm  // this will give all the Commands
npm install -h // this will display the parameter details of install

npm install <package name> // this will install latest version

npm install <package> -g //install packages globally

node environment variables
=-----------------------------
c:\mani> NODE_ENV = production npm install package_name
this will only install dependencies which needs to be run. not for development env;

by default npm will think as development environment


usin npm we can install from 
    NPM 
    or we can use direct git hub URL

ex:
npm install jquery@latest
npm install https://github_URL_FOR JQUERY


if we put any proj in git hub we have to ingnore node_modules folder

.gitignore 
this configuration file is used to mention what are the files or folders to be ignored


versioning (semantic)
---------------
npm uses symantic guidlines

^ symbol tells that install all the minor and patch releases. but not any major version.
ex:
{
    modulename:"^1.2.1"
}

this will install 1.2,1.3,1.4 ... but NOT 2.0
because marjor releases will have breaking changes

~ symbol will install all the patch releases
ex:
{
    modulename:"~1.2.3"

}

this will install 1.2.3,1.2.3,1.2.4 but not 1.3

if we want to install only any specific version then no need to mention ~ or ^


how to find what is outof date
------------------------------------
npm outdated

this will tells that if any outdated packages in current projects

npm update   // this command used to update the already installed packages.

when we run npm update will work only if we use ^ or ~ symbols.
bsed on the symbols it will update major or patch releases

if we dont have package.json and run npm update command then it will
update all the packages in node_moduel folder


update global packages
------------------
npm update http-server -g

un install global packages
-------------------------------
npm uninstall http-server -g


modules

npm install colors --save //used to give colour for the npm projects

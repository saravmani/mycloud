Although you can deploy and manage AD DS in Azure Virtual Machines, we recommend you use Microsoft Entra ID


#### Different between Active directory and Azure Entra ID
- AD DS is primarily a directory service, while Microsoft Entra ID is a full identity solution. Microsoft Entra ID is designed for internet-based applications that use HTTP and HTTPS communications.
- Entra ID doesn't use Kerberos authentication. It implements HTTP and HTTPS protocols, such as SAML, WS-Federation, and OpenID Connect

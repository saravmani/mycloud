npm install npm@latest -g -> to update the npm


npm install -g typescript@2.0   -> To install typescript version 2


npm init
--this will create package.json file with default settings.
--once package.json got created then if we install any other package
--then we have to use npm install <packageName> --save
--this will add the package details in package.json's dependencies section


npm i concurrently --save-dev
//this package used to execute start commands concorrently


npm link <<global module>> // used to link existing global module witth local directory
//ex: we can install express @ globally and we can link to multiple projects with npm link command


to update npm
----------------
npm install npm -g


npm update modulename   //to updaate module specificattly
npm update //all modules

If you just want to check to see if any packages are outdated, use the following:
npm outdated

npm ls  //to find list installed modules
npm ls -g // to find list of moudels installed globally

npm la modulename // this will tell more details of module PLUS
#IF ANY DEPENDENCY TO INSTALLED THIS WILL GIVE SUGGESTION


You can also install a module that’s in a folder on the filesystem, or a tarball
that’s either local or fetched via a URL:
npm install http://somecompany.com/somemodule.tgz

#tarball is one on the file format


If you just want to check to see if any packages are outdated, use the following:
npm outdated

install from git directly
----------------------------
npm install https://github.com/visionmedia/express/tarball/master


npm via PUTTY
--------------------
If you’re working with Node/npm in Linux using the PuTTY application in
Windows, you may notice that you don’t get a clean print out when using
the npm commands. Instead of nicely defined lines showing dependencies,
you get strange characters.
To fix this problem, you need to instruct PuTTY to translate characters
using UTF-8 encoding. In PuTTY, click the Window->Translation option,
and select UTF-8 from the dropdown window.


working with npm configuration
-------------------------------------
npm config list  //gives list of configurations

npm config delete keyname
npm config set keyname value

npm config set save=true
npm config set save-exact=true
This automatically adds a --save flag (to save package in dependencies)
and a --save-exact flag (saved with exact version, not npm’s semver range default)
when you install new packages.



You can also search for a module using whatever terms you think might return
the best selection:
npm search html5 parser

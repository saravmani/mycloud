###### Scale sets (IaaS)
Allow automatic scaling of virtual machines
based on metrics which we configure.
Ensure high availability. Manage VMs. Pay only for added VMs.
Scale sets are identical VMs. Base VM is required to take a copy

###### App Services
1. Web Apps
2. Web apps for containers (create container in local and deploy in Azure)
3. API Apps

###### Azure Functions
also called as server less (this is not PaaS or IaaS. It is Serverless)

### Azure container service
###### ACI (Azure container instance)
It is serverless concept. Execute container without Orchestration.
Runs docker container on-demand

###### Azure Kuberneties Services
ACR - Azure container registry is manages container images
POD - Pods are simply the smallest unit of execution in Kubernetes. And it is a VM which hosts multiple containers

###### Azure Virtual Desktop
Windows 10 license can be reused
Access any where and any device. Uses azure security

#Tags - physical joins, internal joins

Nested Loop Join, Merge Join, Hash Joins

This joins will be automatically choosan by 'query optimiser'.
This decision based on number of rows, number of columns and other factors

Hash Joins
-------------
Hash joins are very efficient on a large set of data
hash joins are is a table that gets created in memory
They're less efficient on a very small set of data because the process of creating the hash table in memory is rather expensive relative to a very small number of rows.
to match values together and bring them together for your join operation

Nested Loop joins
-----------------
##Good for smaller set of data. it will loop through all the rows

Some times may need to give a hint to choose specific type of join
if the optimizer is consistently making a wrong decision on your pattern and it happens,
the database optimizer has a lot of intelligence built into it but sometimes it gets it wrong and you need to influence it.

The RowVersion
mechanism utilizes the database feature where a new value of row version will be
created each time the row is updated.

add RowVersion:rowversion column in Database table

and set
the Concurrency Mode value for the RowVersion column to Fixed.

like FieldLevelConcurrency 
Any time a user tries to update a record, which has been updated by someone else,
he will get the DbUpdateConcurrencyException exception.

# this also filed level. but we are not setting field level for all the columns. only one column 

This mechanism is comparatively more efficient because we are
not setting the concurrency mode for multiple fields but rather for only one field and
getting the concurrency control for the complete row. This will generate better SQL
than setting concurrency for each field separately would have generated.

In older databases, the rowversion data type is not
present. For such databases, the TIMESTAMP data type
can be used to achieve the same results.

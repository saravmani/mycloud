Anti patterns are out comes of following bad practices, over engineering, implementation 
of design patters without having enough knowledge of patterns or not

Copy+Paste 
------------------
his is a favorite of any developer including myself. Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V is part of any developer's 
It is good if you are doing it from external sources to boost your development
 with good understanding of it, but it becomes Anti pattern when you do it with your own code. 
 If you are doing copy and paste of your own code, then it is an Anti pattern.

Spaghetti Code
------------------------
Spaghetti code is a code meaning unstructured code, written by a 
developer who is less experienced or lacks knowledge of Object oriented programming. 
Code written like a procedural programming. In this kind of code, the developer 
himself can't understand his own code after a few days. The code looks like spaghetti.

# so as per my understanding anit patterns means,
the code which writtern is not flexible, non maintanable, over engineered,

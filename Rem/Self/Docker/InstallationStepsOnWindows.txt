To use docker support from visuall studio we need to install "docker desktop" . To install this
OS shoudl be windows 10 professional

# my experience  in docker installation

Download docker for windows from net
when installing it will ask for "enable windows container". just enable it
after restart computer


in command prompt with windows administrator privillage just type
docker ps
now if container is not running then it will try to start
if hyper-v and containers features are not enabled on windows then it will prompt to enable it
just click ok
now system will get restarted
after some time  (it is taking nearly 4 mins after sys restart), docker will prompt to start
click yes,
then docker will get started

docker run -it microsoft/windowsservercore cmd
--using this command we can run the windowsservercore image on docker.

if this image is not available then it will automatically start downloading it

###### Discussion on Docker File and Docker Compose File`


###### Docker File
- It basically a configuration file. Which contains information about
*Dependences, What to do? How to do etc.,*. We can say Docker file helps to dockerize a given applicaiton
- It contains 2 parts
  * Building the applicaiton
  * Run the applicaiton

To Orchestrate we need docker-compose file
  - docker-compose.yml
  - docker-compose.override.yml

  ```ini
version: '3.4'
services:
    bloggerdb:
        container_name: bloggerdb
        restart: always   ## Always restarts the applicatoin in case of ERROR
            volumes: ## Store the data which is generated by container. It is a permenant storage
                - ${WEBAPP_STORAGE_HOME}/SITE:/data/db
            ports:
               -"27017:27017"

    bloggerservice:
        environment:
          - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
          -"DBSettings:ConnectionString=mongodb://bloggerdb:27017"
          // Note here *bloggerdb* is actually a container name
        depends_on:
           - bloggerdb
           // whcih means the second container WILL NOT wait till first container started completely. it just say the order
         volumes:
            - ${HOME}/.microsoft/usersecrets/:/root/.microsoft/usersecrets
            - ${HOME}/.aspnet/https:/root/.aspnet/https/
        ports:
          - "80"
  ```


```csharp
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml  -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
// -d to run in bacgground
```

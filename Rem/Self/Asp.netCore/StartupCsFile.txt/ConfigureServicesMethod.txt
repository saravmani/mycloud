This get called by reflection. it gets IservicesCollection as parameter

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)

{

  var connString = "...connections string...";

  services.AddDbContext<YourDbContext>(options => options.UseSqlServer(connString));
  //Configuring DB context and connection string

}


Adding a service to the IServicesCollection container makes the service further available
to the rest of the application via the ASP.NET Core built-in dependency injection system.

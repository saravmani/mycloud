 
return Json(objComplexType,JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
//note by default JsonRequestBehavior is DenyGet



 To return huge size of json result we need to create new JsonResult object and set the MaxJsonLength parameter.

 return new JsonResult()  
    {  
        Data = data,  //Huge volume data
        ContentType = contentType,  
        ContentEncoding = contentEncoding,  
        JsonRequestBehavior = behavior,  
        MaxJsonLength = Int32.MaxValue  
    }; 


    same way we can able to set RecursionLimit also
    RecursionLimit: Indicates the constraining number of object levels to process. 
The default value is 100. It means you can serialize the objects that are nested to a depth of 100 objects referencing each other. 
In a general scenario the default limit 100 is obviously sufficient when you deal with a
 JsonResult so there is no need to increase it even though you have the option to increase the limit if required.

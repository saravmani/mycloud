debug is node module

instead of 
console.log("normal txt"+chalk.green("green coloured text"));

we can use
var debug = require("debug")("app")
debug("normal txt"+chalk.green("green coloured text"));

advantage of this is it will log only on debug mode
Debug mode command is 

windows - set DEBUG=* & node app.js
Linux - DEBUG=*  node app.js

express also uses debug inside.. so we can see lots of lines in console when we run 
in debug mode

DEBUG=app node app.js
this will logs only "app" logs alone

this "app" word prefixed in all the lines

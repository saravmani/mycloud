First browser will make connecton (socket) to server using TCP.
then on top tcp we can use athor protocols like http, FTP to send the data to server


connection:keep-alive
----------------------------
browser will made tcp connection to server, and reuse the connection accross multiple requests.
If you refresh the page request in the same browser, youâ€™ll only get the request
event message(s).
The connection has already been established, and is
maintained until the user closes the browser or some timeout occurs
the same resource with difference browsers establishes a separate connection
event for each.


connection:close
------------------------
this will create new conneciton on each request

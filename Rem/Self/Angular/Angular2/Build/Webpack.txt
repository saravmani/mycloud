 Webpack creates bundles based on the entry points. 

 bundling css using webpack
 -----------------------------
 Every file/module we want to be used in the bundle webpack expects to be a 
 valid JavaScript module. And certainly styles.css is not a valid JavaScript module. 
 So we need something to turn this CSS module into JS module. 
 And this is where loaders come in.

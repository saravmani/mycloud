LINQ to Entities is the mechanism that facilitates the use of LINQ to write
queries against our conceptual model such as the Entity Data Model.

LINQ to Entities provider will take care of accessing the database and
fetching the required data for us.


Archtecture
-----------------------
Linque --->EntityClient -->Entity Data Model (Entity Framework) -->  ADO.NET

LINQ to Entities will transform our LINQ queries to the EntityClient
commands.


The EntityClient object resides in the System.Data.
EntityClient namespace. We don't have to create this object
explicitly. We just need to use this namespace and LINQ to Entities
will take care of the rest.


If we want to use LINQ to Entities with multiple types of database, we just need to
use the proper ADO.NET provider for the database, and EntityClient will be able
to use this making our LINQ queries work seamlessly against any database.


We can write the linq queries in two type of syntexes

The query syntax
The method syntax

Performance
wise both are the same. The query syntax is comparatively easy to understand
but offers less flexibility. The method syntax, on the contrary, is a little difficult to
understand but offers great flexibility. It is possible to chain multiple queries using the
method syntax and thus achieve maximum results in a single statement.

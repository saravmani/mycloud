There are basically three types of Change:
1. Active change/Statistical change -  ex: add or remove data from existing collection 
2. Passive change/Non-statistical change  - ex: sorting or swapping
3. Data sensitive change - ex: change the existing data

The ObservableCollection<T> class implements two interfaces:
1. INotifyCollectionChanged
2. INotifyPropertyChanged

INotifyCollectionChanged interface has an event called CollectionChanged, which
is triggered when there is an active/statistical change. The INotifyPropertyChanged
interface has an event, PropertyChanged, which can be triggered for any data sensitive
change

All variables and functions defined within the anonymous function aren�t
 available to the code outside of it, effectively using closure to seal
 itself from the outside world.


(function(){
  console.log('Hello World!');
})();
Let's look at this carefully. This code is made up of two key parts.

First is the anonymous function:
(function(){
  //Normal code goes here
})

The really interesting part is what happens when we add this right at the end:
();
Those two little brackets cause everything contained in the preceding parentheses to be executed immediately. 


What�s useful here is that JavaScript has function level scoping. All variables and functions defined within the anonymous function aren�t available to the code outside of it, effectively using closure to seal itself from the outside world.



(function(){alert('ss')}) // this code will not execute automatically
but
(function(){alert('ss')})()// this will be self executable

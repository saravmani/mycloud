git init //use to 
ls -la //this will show all the files 
//even .git file also will be shown

we can run this command on any of the folder.
then ti will be a git repository
the files within this folder will get 
tracked by git

git different places to save the state of file
1. staging environment
  CMD:  git add fileName.js //adding fileName.js file into staging environment
  CMD:  git status  //get the status of the file
  CMD:  git add . //used to add all the files into staging

if we are working on multiple files then we can keep adding
into staging, and finally we can able to commit

CMD: git commit -m "message for the comamnd"
CMD: git log //display commited info

POC:
i tried with - i have edited filename.txt in text editor and tried below command
CMD: git checkout filename.txt 
this command restores the old content what i have previously commited


NOTE: Cloning the repository
CMD: git clone https://github.com/FabianGosebrink/ASPNET-Core-Angular2-SignalR-Typescript


Deleting the file
------------------
just delete file manualy
and try with git checkout filename.txt 
now u can see the file again created.. this is file v
got from staging area
Here git checkout command acts like rollback
Or
CMD: git rm filename.txt //used to delete and stage the changes

CMD: git add --all // it will do adding, deleting into staging
Undo the changes after done staging
--------------------------------------
CMD: git reset HEAD . //undo staging changes
CMD: git checkout .   //undo local changes

Transport security in WCF
---------------------------------
When using HTTP as the transport, security is provided by a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) implementation.



Implementing SSL with WCF
----------------------------------
HTTP transport security (or SSL) is provided externally to WCF. You can implement SSL in one of two ways; the deciding factor is how your application is hosted:

If you are using Internet Information Services (IIS) as your WCF host, use the IIS infrastructure to set up an SSL service.

If you are creating a self-hosted WCF application, you can bind an SSL certificate to the address using the HttpCfg.exe tool.

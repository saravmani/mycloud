Starting with the .NET Framework version 2.0, a
StackOverflowException object cannot be caught by a try-catch block and the corresponding process is terminated by default.
Consequently, users are advised to write their code to detect and prevent a stack overflow.
For example, if your application depends on recursion, use a counter or a state condition to terminate the recursive loop.

My Example
---------------
# 
Class Account
{
    SanctionedAmount objSanctionedAmount;
}

Class SanctionedAmount
{
   long AmountSanctionedForCurrentMonth
   long PerDayLimit;//ex: 1000
   public static SanctionedAmount operator+ (SanctionedAmount amt,SanctionedAmount amt2) {
   }

}

now i can use

var sumOfBoth = lastMSanctionedAmount+CurrentMonthSanctionedAmount;

like this i can give more meaning to my code. and increase readability

we can give good example with 4G Data plan whcih we are using for mobile
if airtel company wants to carry forward previous month's data to next month then.. 


In SB2 we can use operator overloading in Subject merger.
we can add subject A and B and generate new one as C

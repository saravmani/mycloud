#### Discussion Clean Architecture
###### Discussion Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture is a set of practices (Including best practices in SOLID Principles) used to create a modern Architecture
Which is simple, maintainable, flexible, Testable Architecture

#### Layers and responsibility
###### 1. Presentation Layer
* Api versioning
* Routing
* Authentication and Autherisation
* Configure dependencies (Acting as assembler)




In Domain centric Architecture we have to focus on essential parts like Domain and Use cases. Not the implementations like technology, db etc.,


In Layered Architecture each layer should have single responsibility and clear boundary.
It should be a manageable unit and reduce the complexity
Create and Maintaining Layers are costly. Try to reduce the number of laters as much as possible

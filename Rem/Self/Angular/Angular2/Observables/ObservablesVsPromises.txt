Observables Vs Promises
------------------------------

Observables are cancellable
retryWhen and retry availabile
# It is stream of events. for each event callback will get called 
Observable provides map, forEach, reduce, debounce etc.,
There are also powerful operators like retry(), or replay()


Observables can be retried using one of the retry operators provided by the API, 
such as retry and retryWhen. On the other hand, Promises require the caller to have access 
to the original function that returned the promise in order to have a retry capability.

Often Observable is preferred over Promise because it provides the features of Promise and more.

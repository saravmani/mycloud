HTTP modules are specific to IIS. if we go with self hosting, those modules will not be executed4

When the host authenticates the user, it creates a principal, which is an IPrincipal

The principal contains an associated Identity object that contains information about the user.
If the user is authenticated, the Identity.IsAuthenticated property returns true.

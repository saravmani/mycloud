Authorization Filter
----------------------------------------------

There is a somewhat involved relationship between the authentication and authorization filters

public interface IAuthorizationFilter {
void OnAuthorization(AuthorizationContext filterContext);
}


MVC Framework has provided a full-featured authorization filter, which can be derived to implement custom authorization policies.
I try to use this whenever I can, and I recommend that you do the same. At the least, you can pass some of the
blame to Microsoft when your secret application data is spread far and wide on the Internet.

much safer approach is to create a subclass of the AuthorizeAttribute class which takes care of all of the tricky
stuff and makes it easy to write custom authorization code

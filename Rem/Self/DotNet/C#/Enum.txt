Advantages over constants
-----------------------------
nums limit you to the required set of inputs whereas even if you 
use constant strings you still can use other String not part of your logic.

This helps you to not make a mistake, to enter something out of the domain, 
while entering data and also improves the program readability.


General Advantages
-----------------------
#more code readability,
#avoid errors (restricting clients to use only set of values)
Makes it easy to change values in the future.

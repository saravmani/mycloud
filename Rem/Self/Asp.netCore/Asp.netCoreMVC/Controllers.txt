Controllers can be created in 3 ways

1. inherit from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Controller
2. no inherit from any class, but usffix with Controller XXXXController
3. decorate the class with [Controller] attribute (in general Classes that inherit from Controller,
which inherits from ControllerBase, will automatically get the [Controller] attribute
because they reside in the ControllerBase class. )

Note: to avoid normall classes with "Controller as suffix" to be marked as controller
we can use the attribute [NoController]

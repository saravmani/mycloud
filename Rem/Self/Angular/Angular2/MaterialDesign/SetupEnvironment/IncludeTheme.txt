Including a theme is required to apply all of the core and theme styles to your application.

To get started with a prebuilt theme, include one of Angular Material's prebuilt themes globally in your application. If you're using the Angular CLI, you can add this to your styles.css:

@import "~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css";
If you are not using the Angular CLI, you can include a prebuilt theme via a <link> element in your index.html.

For more information on theming and instructions on how to create a custom theme, see the theming guide.

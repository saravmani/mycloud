MIT is used for open source projects
  You have permission to use the code, to modify it, publish it, sell it, make something with it and sell it, etc.

  Restrictions
  ------------------
  You have very few restrictions -- basically you cannot remove the license and copyright text from the code when you share it.
  This is easy when you share this in source code -- just don't delete the text.

understand versioning
   ex: what is semantic versioning
        major.minor.patch
        --MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and.
         PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.


versioning (semantic,symantic)
---------------
npm uses symantic guidlines

^ symbol tells that install all the minor and patch releases. but not any major version.
ex:
{
    modulename:"^1.2.1"
}

this will install 1.2,1.3,1.4 ... but NOT 2.0
because marjor releases will have breaking changes

~ symbol will install all the patch releases
ex:
{
    modulename:"~1.2.3"

}

this will install 1.2.3,1.2.3,1.2.4 but not 1.3

if we want to install only any specific version then no need to mention ~ or ^

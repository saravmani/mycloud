Mutex
--------
Same like lock. but it can be used accross the multiple processes
Ex:
	var objMutex = new Mutex();

            var firsttask = new System.Threading.Tasks.Task(() =>
             {
                 var ss = "";
                 objMutex.WaitOne();
                 objMutex.ReleaseMutex();
                 ss = "";
             });

            new System.Threading.Tasks.Task(() =>
            {
                var ss = "";
                objMutex.WaitOne();
                Thread.Sleep(5000);
                objMutex.ReleaseMutex();

                ss = "";

            }).Start();
            firsttask.Start();

Thread Vs Process
-------------------------
Threads are used for small tasks, whereas processes are used for more 'heavyweight' tasks
basically the execution of applications.
Another difference between a thread and a process is
that threads within the same process share the same address space, whereas different processes do not.

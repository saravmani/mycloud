The Configure method is used to configure the HTTP request pipeline and to specify the
modules that will have a chance to process incoming HTTP requests.
Modules and loose code that can be added to the HTTP request pipeline are collectively referred to as middleware.


public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, IApplicationLifetime lifeTime)

{

//IApplicationLifetime is hvaing cancelation tokens for startup, stop, stopping 

//This method will get the parameter objects through DI

if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseBrowserLink();
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
}
else
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");//It is like Application_Error Event in global.asax
}
app.UseStaticFiles();
}


A very common action you would take in the Configure method is enabling the ability to
serve static files and a centralized error handler.

To check the custome environment we cand use env.IsEnvironment("CustomeEnvName");
For standard enveronments  env.IsProduction(),env.IsDevelopment(), IsStaging()

Note that environment names are not case-sensitive in Windows and Mac, but they are case-sensitive in Linux.

order in which services are configured is important. For this reason, the first thing you want to do in Configure is set up error handling right after the static files.

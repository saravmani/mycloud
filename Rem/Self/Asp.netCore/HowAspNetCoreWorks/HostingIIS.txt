asp.ent core is seperate console applicaiton

IIS will communciate with asp.netcore console app through some port
For this IIS needs some HttpModules


before year 2003 ASP.NET 1.x and IIS was worked in this same model.
Asp.At that time, ASP.NET had its own worker process communicating with IIS through named pipes.
Later, the tasks of the ASP.NET worker process have been absorbed by the built-in IIS worker
process (w3wp.exe), creating the concept of application pools.


ASP.NET Core IIS Module (ANCM),
------------------------------------
ANCM must be installed in IIS on the server (or IIS Express on your
development machine) for the IIS integration to work. Visual Studio automatically
installs ANCM for us on IIS Express. ANCM for servers can be downloaded from

## note here IISExpress also needs this module. so in development environment, when we run applicaiton
in IISExpress, then it is doing reverse proxy and passing the request to kestrol :-)

Configuration will take heirarchy as below
-------------------------------------------------
appsettings.json -> Environment variables -> Command line argument
Environment variables will override appsettings.json values. 
and command line argument will override both.
This will be useful. we can have development settings in appsettings.json. 
production settings in env varabiles.
so appsettings.json changes will not affect the applicaiton

We can able to configure multipe appsettings files.
asp.net core will will check the files in below names
appsettings.json
appsettings.{EnvironmentName}.json //ex:appsettings.Development.json

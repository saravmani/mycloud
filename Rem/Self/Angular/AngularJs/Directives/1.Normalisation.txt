Normalization
AngularJS normalizes an element's tag and attribute name to determine which elements match which directives.
ex:
ngModel  - in js
is equal to
ng-model - in html


The normalization process is as follows:

Strip x- and data- from the front of the element/attributes.
Convert the :, -, or _-delimited name to camelCase.

ex Below all are same
<div ng-controller="Controller">
  Hello <input ng-model='name'> <hr/>
  <span ng-bind="name"></span> <br/>
  <span ng:bind="name"></span> <br/>
  <span ng_bind="name"></span> <br/>
  <span data-ng-bind="name"></span> <br/>
  <span x-ng-bind="name"></span> <br/>
</div>


Best Practice: Prefer using the dash-delimited format (e.g. ng-bind for ngBind). If you want to use an HTML validating tool, you can instead use the data-prefixed version (e.g. data-ng-bind for ngBind). The other forms shown above are accepted for legacy reasons but we advise you to avoid them.

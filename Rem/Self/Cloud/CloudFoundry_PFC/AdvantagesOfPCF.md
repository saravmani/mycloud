1. Developers can focus on app development no need to worry on infra (Ex: OS, Anti virus etc.,)
2. Time to market is easy
3. Developer can choose best runtime/technology or they can choose multi technology with PCF (aka - polyglot programming)
3. Developer can simply create a manifest file and do the deployment
4. Developer can achive Ifrastructure as a code concept
5. Within organisation splitup the teams with cleane boundary
6. It has own market place from there we can start using any services easily (Ex: DB, RabbitMQ etc.,)
7. CF is best for microservices Architecture. It can run multiple runt times, handle different type of work loades, can use different OS

Ex: Developer can develop applicaiton local and pusth to CF. Then CF will take care of testing, deployment , routing, monitoring, logging, managing, auto-scallaing etc.,

Developers no need to bundle the runtime into applicaion. Run times will be readily awailable at Cloud Foundry

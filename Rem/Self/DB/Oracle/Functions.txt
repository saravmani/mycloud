We cannot call procedures within the function


##This is applicable in SQL server. But dont know in Oracle
Functions are computed values and cannot perform permanent environmental
changes to the SQL Server.


Two types of functions
Scalar  fucntions
table value functions

Scalar functions
-------------------
A scalar function is a function that is defined in the database and returns a scalar
value. For example, if we need to find the EmployerId for an Employee by passing
the ID of the Employee,

Table Valued Functions
---------------------------
Table valued functions (TVF) are simply the user-defined functions that return
tabular data.

AMAZON WEB SERVICES
 AWS consists of a range of different hosting-related services, like
email delivery, content-delivery networks, and lots more. Amazon’s Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2), one of AWS’s central services, allows you to create servers in the cloud
whenever you need them.
EC2 virtual servers are called instances, and they can be managed using either the
command line or a web-based control console, shown in figure 12.2. As command-line
use of AWS takes some time to get used to, the web-based console is recommended for
first-time users.
Luckily, because AWS is ubiquitous, it’s easy to get help online and find related
tutorials, such as Amazon’s “Getting Started with Amazon EC2 Linux Instances”

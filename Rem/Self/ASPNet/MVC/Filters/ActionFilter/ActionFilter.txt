An action filter (can also be call as attribute filter) is an attribute which is applicable for a controller action
Action filters are filters that can be used for any purpose

ActionFilterAttribute class implements both the IActionFilter and IResultFilter interfaces. This class
is abstract, which forces you to provide an implementation.


  
Few Action filters readily available in MVC
========================================================
1. OutputCache
 [OutputCache(Duration=20)]
          public string Index()
          {
               return "The time is " +  DateTime.Now;

          }

Uses of Action filter
-------------------------
change view data
inspect the request and elect to cancel the request
 modify the request
Action Filters used in Aspect Oriented Programming

MVC provides ActionFilterAttribute which includes both IActionFilter, IResultFilter.
only benefit of ActionFilterAttribute is that you do not need to override and implement the methods that you do
not intend to use. Otherwise, there is no advantage over implementing the filter interfaces directly.

Custome Authentication filter
-----------------------------------------
 four virtual methods OnActionExecuting, OnActionExecuted, OnResultExecuting, and OnResultExecuted that you may override. 


 OnActionExecuting is called before the action method is called and OnActionExecuted is called after the action method is called. 
 The OnResultExecuting method is called when the ActionResult is returned by your action is invoked. 
 The OnResultExecuted method is called just after the result is executed.



 public interface IActionFilter {
    void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext);
    void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext);
}

propertis of ActionExecutingContext
-------------------------------------------
ActionDescriptor
Result - The result for the action method; a filter can cancel the request by setting
        this property to a non-null value


You can use a filter to cancel the request by setting the Result property of the parameter to an action result


ActionExecutedContext Properties
------------------------------------
ActionDescriptor
Canceled - Returns true if the action has been canceled by another filter
Exception - Returns an exception thrown by another filter or by the action method
ExceptionHandled - Returns true if the exception has been handled
Result - The result for the action method; a filter can cancel the request by
         setting this property to a non-null value


The Canceled property will return true if another filter has canceled the request (by setting a value for the Result
property) since the time that the filterâ€™s OnActionExecuting method was invoked. The OnActionExecuted method will
still be called, but only so that it can tidy up and release any resources the filter was using.

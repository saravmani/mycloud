understand cloning (shallow copy and deep copy)
-----------------------
The cloning operation is of two types â€” shallow copy and deep copy.
In the case of shallow copy, simple
type fields of a class are copied into the cloned instance. For reference type fields,
only the reference pointer
is copied (the values they hold are not copied). This means the original as well as the cloned object points to
the same reference. The shallow copy can be performed using the MemberwiseClone() method of the Object
base class (every class in .NET is implicitly inherited from the Object base class).

In the case of deep copy, simple as well as reference type fields are copied into the cloned object. Thus,
the original and the cloned object get independent copies of the reference type fields. The deep copy can be
performed through a custom serialization technique

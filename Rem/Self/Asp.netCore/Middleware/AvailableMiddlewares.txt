Order of the middleware is important
app.UseWelcomePage() // this is the middleware for testing purpose. 
it will provide default welcome page


app.UseStaticFiles();//Used to serve static files.
//This will serve files only from wwwroot folder and its subfolders
//We can able to change the folder path where it needs to look in

app.UseDefaultFiles();//used to serve default file, when root path navigated
            //we can able to configure default file name.
            // it will automatically detect index.html file
            //this will not directly serve the file. it will just change the request's path, so that
            UseStaticFiles middleware can abel to server the path
            so order of middle wares should be - UseDefaultFiles() first then UseStaticFiles()

app.UseFileServer();//this will internally include UseDefaultFiles,UseFileServer

MVC itself is a middleware

To make a Universal app, you install the platform-server package

!: The platform-server package has server implementations of the DOM, 
XMLHttpRequest, and other low-level features that do not rely on a browser.


You compile the client application with the platform-server module instead of the platform-browser module. 
and run the resulting Universal app on a web server.


!!
Because a Universal platform-server app doesn't execute in the browser, 
you may have to work around some of the browser APIs and capabilities that are missing on the server.

You won't be able reference browser-only native objects such as window, document, navigator or location.

Why unit testing required? do we need to really implement unit testing for ALL the features?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I tend to focus on writing unit tests for features and functions that I know will be hard to
write and that are likely to be the source of bugs in deployment. In these situations, unit testing helps
structure my thoughts about how to best implement what I need. I find that just thinking about what I
need to test helps produce ideas about potential problems, and thatâ€™s before I start dealing with actual
bugs and defects.


#MyIdea
----------
Splitup the complex functionality as multiple testable logical parts 
and create unit test for those seperately. So that based on unit test result, we can able to focus
the logical part specifically and solve it.
Ex: 
Name search in Search Component we can write unit test for
    scoring
    ircs call
    filtering
    DB call

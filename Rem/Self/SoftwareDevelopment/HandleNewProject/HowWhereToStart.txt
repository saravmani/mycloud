Requirement gathering
Technology identification 
Base architecture design
Find out common features required accross all the modules 
  ex: Db connection, Logging etc.,
Create common utilities
Create common functionalities seperatly
Create a framework to do the common functionalities
Find the modules which are already available in market ex: loggin framework, caching framewokrs,
    and buy or borrow those modules and make use of them. So that we can focus on only
    domain specific coding

Try seperate the modules with LESS dependency to each other. 
     so that teams can work independently

Try to use dependency containers. so that teams can work with interfaces alone.
(Microservers architecture used to develop the fearures independently)



Component diagrams - Put all the components in component diagram and mention
  what are the functionalities
Sequence diagrams - to define the flows

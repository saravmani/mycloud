Connect - NodeJS framework
------------------------------
    Connect is a framework, it connects the middleware components together using dispatcher.


    Connect is a framework that uses modular components called middleware to implement

higher-level frameworks like Express extends and builds upon Connect with additional higher-level sugar.
If we work with express we no need do coding with connect seperatly
